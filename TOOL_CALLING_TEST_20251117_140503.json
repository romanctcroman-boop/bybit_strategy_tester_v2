  "content": "I apologize for the technical difficulties. It appears there's an issue with the tool execution system. Based on the task description, you're asking me to:\n\n1. Read the file `backend/api/app.py`\n2. List all MCP tools I find in that file\n\nHowever, I'm unable to access the file system due to tool execution errors. To help you with this task, I would need:\n\n1. **Direct file content**: If you can provide the content of `backend/api/app.py` directly\n2. **Alternative access**: If there's another way to access the file system\n\nOnce I can access the file content, I'll be able to:\n- Analyze the Python code\n- Identify any MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools being used\n- List them systematically with their configurations and usage patterns\n\nCould you please provide the file content directly, or let me know if there's an alternative way to access the backend API code?",
