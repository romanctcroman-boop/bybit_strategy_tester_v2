    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1) with 0% coverage. This indicates either a catastrophic test infrastructure failure or severe code/test compatibility issues.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **Total coverage: 0%** - No code was executed during test run\n- **No coverage data available** - Execution halted before any meaningful testing occurred\n- **Critical gap**: Entire test suite is non-functional\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Integration test failure** (`test_integration_full.py`) likely contains breaking changes\n2. **Fixture/config issues** (`conftest.py`) may have introduced dependency problems or infinite loops\n3. **Possible causes**: \n   - Import/circular dependency errors\n   - Fixture setup/teardown failures\n   - Environment/config mismatches\n   - Critical exceptions in test setup\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. **Debug test execution**: Run `pytest -xvs tests/test_integration_full.py` to identify failure point\n2. **Check fixture integrity**: Validate `conftest.py` changes haven't broken test dependencies\n3. **Isolate the failure**: Temporarily revert recent changes to identify the breaking commit\n\n**Short-term:**\n4. Add test environment validation in `conftest.py`\n5. Implement test execution timeouts to catch hanging tests\n6. Add basic smoke tests to verify test infrastructure\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- No reliable test feedback on code changes\n- Potential for undetected production defects\n- Development workflow severely impacted\n- Urgent attention required before further deployments\n\n**Priority: Critical** - Must resolve before any additional code changes or releases.",
