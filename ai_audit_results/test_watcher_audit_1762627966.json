No tests executed successfully.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This represents maximum coverage gap - entire codebase is untested.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe `mcp-server/server.py` modification likely introduced:\n- **Syntax errors** preventing import/execution\n- **Missing dependencies** causing import failures\n- **Runtime exceptions** during test setup\n- **Environment configuration** issues\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n1. **Immediate Priority: Fix Test Execution**\n   - Check Python syntax: `python -m py_compile mcp-server/server.py`\n   - Verify imports and dependencies\n   - Run with verbose output to identify crash point\n\n2. **Establish Basic Test Foundation**\n   - Add minimal smoke test to verify server starts\n   - Implement basic unit tests for core functions\n   - Set up CI to fail fast on syntax/runtime errors\n\n3. **Coverage Recovery Plan**\n   - Target 70%+ coverage for critical paths first\n   - Focus on error handling and edge cases\n   - Add integration tests for server endpoints\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Code is completely untested and potentially unstable. Deployment would be extremely risky. Critical bugs could go undetected until production failures occur.\n\n**Next Action**: Fix the immediate test execution failure before addressing coverage metrics.",
