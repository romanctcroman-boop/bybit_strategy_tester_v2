This suggests fundamental issues in test infrastructure or environment setup rather than test failures.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **0% coverage** confirms tests didn't execute properly\n- No coverage data available for analysis\n- Likely environment/dependency issues preventing test execution\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Infrastructure Break**: Changes in `backend\\core\\mtf_engine.py` or `reliability\\perplexity_client.py` may have broken core functionality\n2. **Test Configuration**: Modifications to `tests\\backend\\conftest.py` could have disrupted test setup\n3. **Dependency Conflicts**: New integration tests (`test_sandbox_integration.py`) may have unmet dependencies\n4. **Resource Issues**: Stress tests (`test_edge_cases_stress.py`) might be exhausting system resources\n\n## Immediate Action Plan\n1. **Diagnose Exit Code -1**:\n   - Check test runner logs for stack traces\n   - Verify Python environment and dependencies\n   - Ensure database connections in query optimization tests\n\n2. **Isolate the Break**:\n   - Run tests individually starting with basic unit tests\n   - Test `test_batch_writer.py` in isolation first\n   - Check if `conftest.py` changes broke fixture setup\n\n3. **Quick Fixes**:\n   - Roll back recent changes to `conftest.py` if possible\n   - Verify all imports in modified files\n   - Check for missing environment variables\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Unable to validate any functionality due to complete test failure. Deployment in this state would be extremely risky.\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution immediately before any further development or analysis.",
