This represents a complete testing infrastructure failure.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% coverage** - No code was executed during testing. This is not a coverage gap but a complete testing system failure.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe changed file `tests\\backend\\conftest.py` is highly suspicious:\n- Likely contains syntax errors or import failures\n- May have broken pytest configuration/hooks\n- Could be missing critical fixtures or imports\n- Possibly introduced circular dependencies\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. **Debug conftest.py** - Check for syntax errors, missing imports, or configuration issues\n2. **Run pytest with `-v` flag** to see specific error messages\n3. **Test isolation** - Run tests without the modified conftest.py to verify it's the root cause\n4. **Rollback** the conftest.py changes if immediate fix isn't apparent\n\n**Process Improvements:**\n- Add pre-commit hooks to validate pytest configuration\n- Implement CI pipeline that fails fast on configuration errors\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - The entire test suite is non-functional, meaning:\n- No regression detection\n- No validation of recent code changes\n- High probability of undetected bugs in production\n- Complete loss of testing confidence\n\n**Priority: CRITICAL** - Fix immediately before any further development or deployments.",
