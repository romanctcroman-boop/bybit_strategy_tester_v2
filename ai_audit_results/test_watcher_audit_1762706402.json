This indicates either catastrophic test infrastructure issues or severe code defects preventing test execution.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This is not a coverage gap but a complete test failure.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n- The changed file `reliability\\__init__.py` likely contains syntax errors, import issues, or runtime exceptions\n- Possible circular imports or missing dependencies\n- Environment configuration problems (Python path, missing packages)\n- Test runner configuration issues\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Fix Test Execution First**\n   - Check `reliability\\__init__.py` for syntax errors\n   - Verify all imports resolve correctly\n   - Run with `python -m py_compile reliability\\__init__.py` to validate syntax\n\n2. **Debug Infrastructure**\n   - Run tests with `-v` flag for verbose output\n   - Check test runner configuration\n   - Verify Python environment and dependencies\n\n3. **Isolate the Problem**\n   - Test the module directly: `python -c \"import reliability\"`\n   - Run minimal test case to identify root cause\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Production code cannot be validated. Any changes in the reliability module are completely untested and may contain critical defects. Deployment should be blocked until tests execute successfully.",
