    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1). No tests ran successfully, indicating either:\n- Syntax errors in test files or code\n- Missing dependencies or environment issues\n- Test framework configuration problems\n- Fatal errors during test setup\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This represents a complete testing failure, not just low coverage.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe single changed file `analyze_ide_direct.py` likely contains:\n- Syntax errors preventing import/execution\n- Missing imports or dependencies\n- Runtime errors during module loading\n- Circular imports or initialization issues\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. **Fix test execution first** - Run tests with verbose output to identify the fatal error\n2. **Check syntax** - Validate `analyze_ide_direct.py` for basic Python syntax compliance\n3. **Verify imports** - Ensure all dependencies are available in test environment\n4. **Run minimal test** - Create a simple smoke test to verify basic functionality\n\n**Follow-up:**\n5. Add basic unit tests before addressing coverage\n6. Implement CI pipeline with fail-fast testing\n7. Add static analysis (pylint, mypy) to catch issues pre-runtime\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- Production code may be completely broken\n- No safety net for regression detection\n- High probability of undetected runtime errors\n- Deployment would be extremely risky\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
