    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests didn't execute properly (Exit Code -1). This indicates either:\n- Syntax errors in test files or code\n- Import failures or dependency issues\n- Test framework configuration problems\n- Fatal errors during test setup\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% coverage is catastrophic** - No code is being tested. This means:\n- Tests may not be running the target code at all\n- Test discovery/execution is fundamentally broken\n- Recent changes likely broke the test infrastructure\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe changed file `full_ai_audit_deepseek_perplexity_deepseek.py` likely contains:\n- Syntax errors preventing import/execution\n- Missing dependencies or imports\n- Breaking changes to function signatures\n- Configuration errors in test runners\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n\n**URGENT ACTIONS (Next 2 hours):**\n1. **Fix Exit Code -1 first** - Check test logs for fatal errors\n2. **Verify file can be imported** - `python -c \"import full_ai_audit_deepseek_perplexity_deepseek\"`\n3. **Run tests with verbose output** - `pytest -vvs` to see what's failing\n4. **Check for syntax errors** - `python -m py_compile full_ai_audit_deepseek_perplexity_deepseek.py`\n\n**Short-term (Today):**\n5. Add basic smoke test that imports and instantiates main classes\n6. Fix any dependency/import issues\n7. Ensure test discovery is working (check `pytest --collect-only`)\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- **Deployment Risk:** Cannot safely deploy with 0% test coverage\n- **Regression Risk:** No protection against breaking changes\n- **Quality Risk:** Code quality cannot be measured or guaranteed\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
