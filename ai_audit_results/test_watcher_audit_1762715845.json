This indicates fundamental issues in test setup or code structure.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This represents a complete testing failure, not just low coverage.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Import/Initialization Failure** - The changed `reliability\\__init__.py` likely contains syntax errors, import cycles, or initialization code that crashes\n2. **Module Loading Issues** - Python cannot properly import/load the reliability module\n3. **Test Configuration Problems** - Test runner cannot discover or execute tests\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. **Fix Import Issues** - Check `__init__.py` for syntax errors, circular imports, or missing dependencies\n2. **Verify Module Structure** - Ensure `reliability/` directory has proper `__init__.py` and accessible modules\n3. **Run Basic Python Check** - Execute `python -c \"import reliability\"` to isolate the import failure\n4. **Check Test Discovery** - Verify test files are properly named (test_*.py) and located in discoverable paths\n\n**FOLLOW-UP:**\n- Add basic smoke tests to verify module imports\n- Implement test environment validation in CI/CD pipeline\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - No testing validation exists for the reliability module. Any defects could go undetected, potentially affecting system stability and data integrity. The codebase is currently untested and potentially broken.\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution before any further development or deployment.",
