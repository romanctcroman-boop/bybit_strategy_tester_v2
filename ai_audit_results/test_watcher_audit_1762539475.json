    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution crashed completely (exit code -1) with zero coverage. This indicates either a catastrophic test environment failure or severe code defects preventing test execution.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **Total Coverage: 0.00%** - No code was executed\n- **No coverage data available** - Tests failed before coverage collection could begin\n- **Critical gap**: Unable to assess actual code coverage due to execution failure\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Integration test crash** - `test_e2e_audit_agent.py` likely contains fatal errors\n2. **Environment/dependency issues** - Missing imports, broken dependencies, or configuration problems\n3. **Test fixture/setup failures** - Before-all hooks or test initialization crashing\n4. **Code defects in audit agent** - Recent changes may have introduced fatal errors\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. Run tests with `-v` flag to identify which specific test is crashing\n2. Check test logs for stack traces and error messages\n3. Verify all dependencies are installed and compatible\n4. Test the audit agent module in isolation\n\n**Debugging Steps:**\n1. Add try-catch blocks in test setup to capture exceptions\n2. Run tests with `--tb=short` for cleaner error output\n3. Check for infinite loops or resource exhaustion in audit agent\n4. Validate test database connections and external dependencies\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- Production code may be completely broken\n- No safety net for recent changes\n- Potential deployment blockers\n- Audit functionality (critical component) is untested\n\n**Priority**: Resolve immediately before any further deployments or changes to the audit agent module.",
