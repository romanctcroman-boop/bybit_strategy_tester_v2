No tests ran successfully, indicating fundamental issues with the test environment, dependencies, or test code structure.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **0% coverage** across all files\n- No code was executed during test run\n- Complete testing blackout - no metrics available for analysis\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Test file corruption**: `tests\\test_safe_async_bridge_simple.py` likely contains syntax errors or import failures\n2. **Environment mismatch**: Missing dependencies or incompatible Python version\n3. **Configuration issues**: pytest/coverage configuration may be broken\n4. **Fixtures/setup failures**: Critical setup code failing before tests execute\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. Run `python -m pytest tests/test_safe_async_bridge_simple.py -v` to see specific failure details\n2. Check for syntax errors: `python -m py_compile tests/test_safe_async_bridge_simple.py`\n3. Verify dependencies: `pip list` and compare with requirements\n4. Examine recent commits to the test file for breaking changes\n\n**FOLLOW-UP:**\n- Add test discovery validation to CI pipeline\n- Implement pre-commit hooks for syntax checking\n- Create smoke tests to validate test environment\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Production code is completely untested. Any defects could reach production undetected. Testing pipeline is non-functional, creating significant deployment risk.\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
