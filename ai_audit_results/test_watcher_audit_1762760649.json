    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional:\n- Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely unhandled exception)\n- Zero test execution suggests fundamental infrastructure or import issues\n- No coverage data collected implies tests never ran\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**NO COVERAGE** - All files show 0% coverage:\n- Complete absence of test execution\n- Cannot assess actual coverage gaps since tests didn't run\n- Reliability module changes completely untested\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Import/Circular Dependencies** - Changes in `reliability\\` module may have broken imports\n2. **Test Infrastructure Failure** - Test runner configuration or environment issues\n3. **Breaking API Changes** - Circuit breaker or cache interface modifications\n4. **Missing Dependencies** - New imports without corresponding requirements\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. Run tests individually to identify failing component:\n   ```bash\n   python -m pytest test_medium_tasks.py -v\n   python -m pytest reliability/ -v\n   ```\n2. Check for import errors in `reliability` module\n3. Verify all new dependencies are installed\n4. Add try/catch blocks in test setup to capture initialization errors\n\n**STRUCTURAL FIXES:**\n1. Implement basic smoke tests for test infrastructure\n2. Add module-level import tests\n3. Set up continuous integration with dependency installation\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- Production reliability features completely untested\n- High probability of runtime errors in circuit breaker and distributed cache\n- No safety net for recent changes\n- Potential deployment blockers\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
