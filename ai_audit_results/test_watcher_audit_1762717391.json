    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely unhandled exception or environment crash). No tests executed successfully.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% coverage = Complete test infrastructure failure**\n- No code was executed during test run\n- Coverage reporting system failed entirely\n- All test scenarios are effectively untested\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Integration test file** (`test_real_api_integration.py`):\n   - Likely contains unhandled exceptions or missing dependencies\n   - May be making live API calls without proper mocking/error handling\n   - Could have infinite loops or resource exhaustion\n\n2. **Deepseek client** (`deepseek_client.py`):\n   - Probable source of crashing exceptions\n   - Missing imports, authentication failures, or network timeouts\n   - May have breaking API changes or configuration issues\n\n## Recommendations\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. Run tests with `-v` flag to see which specific test crashes\n2. Check test logs for stack traces and error messages\n3. Isolate integration tests from unit tests\n4. Add try-catch blocks around API calls in integration tests\n\n**Short-term:**\n1. Mock external API dependencies in integration tests\n2. Add test environment validation at startup\n3. Implement circuit breakers for external service calls\n\n**Long-term:**\n1. Set up test containers/docker for reliable integration testing\n2. Add health checks for external dependencies\n3. Implement gradual test execution (unit → integration → e2e)\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deployment would be extremely dangerous:\n- No verification that code changes work\n- Integration points completely untested\n- Potential for production outages\n- Data corruption or security risks from untested API interactions\n\n**Priority:** Fix test infrastructure immediately before any further development or deployment.",
