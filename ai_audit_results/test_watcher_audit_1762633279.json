No tests ran successfully, indicating fundamental issues with the test infrastructure or environment setup.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This represents a complete testing failure rather than coverage gaps.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **conftest.py modifications** likely introduced breaking changes\n2. Possible issues:\n   - Syntax errors in test configuration\n   - Missing dependencies/fixtures\n   - Environment setup failures\n   - Import errors or circular dependencies\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. **Fix conftest.py** - Revert changes or debug configuration errors\n2. **Run tests individually** to isolate the failure point\n3. **Check test environment** - Verify dependencies and Python path\n4. **Validate imports** - Ensure all modules can be imported correctly\n\n**FOLLOW-UP:**\n5. Add basic smoke test to prevent complete test suite collapse\n6. Implement test execution monitoring to catch early failures\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - No test validation is occurring, meaning:\n- All code changes are untested\n- Regression risks are extremely high\n- Production deployment would be dangerous\n- Critical bugs could go undetected\n\n**Priority: Fix immediately before any further development.**",
