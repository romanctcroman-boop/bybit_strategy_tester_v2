    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution crashed completely (Exit Code -1). This indicates severe infrastructure, dependency, or code issues rather than test failures. The test suite is non-functional.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% coverage** - No code was executed. This isn't a coverage gap but a complete execution failure. All production code remains untested.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n- **File `tests/test_edge_cases_stress.py`** likely contains code causing catastrophic failure:\n  - Infinite loops or recursion\n  - Memory exhaustion from stress testing\n  - Missing dependencies/imports\n  - Syntax errors or runtime exceptions\n  - Resource exhaustion (file handles, network connections)\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. **Isolate the failing test** - Run `test_edge_cases_stress.py` separately to identify the crash\n2. **Add debug output** - Insert print statements or use `pdb` to trace execution\n3. **Check resource limits** - Verify memory, timeout, and file descriptor constraints\n4. **Validate test dependencies** - Ensure all required packages are installed\n\n**STRUCTURAL FIXES:**\n1. Implement test isolation - run stress tests separately from main suite\n2. Add timeout decorators for stress tests\n3. Set up continuous integration with resource monitoring\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - The entire test pipeline is broken:\n- No regression detection\n- All code changes are effectively untested\n- Deployment risks are extremely high\n- Team cannot trust test results\n\n**Priority:** Fix immediately before any further development or deployments.",
