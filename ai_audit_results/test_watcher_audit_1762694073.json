Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely segmentation fault, environment crash, or fatal Python error).\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% coverage** confirms no tests executed successfully. This represents maximum risk - we have zero visibility into code behavior.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n- `analyze_with_deepseek.py` likely contains code causing fatal runtime errors\n- Possible causes: infinite recursion, memory exhaustion, corrupted imports, or system resource exhaustion\n- Syntax errors or missing dependencies preventing test execution\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n\n**URGENT ACTIONS:**\n1. **Debug test runner failure** - Run tests with `python -m pytest -v` to see exact error\n2. **Check for infinite loops** - Add timeout guards in `analyze_with_deepseek.py`\n3. **Validate imports and dependencies** - Ensure all required packages are installed\n4. **Test in isolation** - Run minimal test case to identify root cause\n\n**SHORT-TERM:**\n- Add basic unit tests for core functions before complex integration\n- Implement try/catch blocks around suspicious code sections\n- Add logging to track execution flow\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**SEVERE RISK** - Code is completely untested and crashing. High probability of production failures, data corruption, or system instability if deployed.\n\n**Priority: CRITICAL** - Fix test execution before any further development or deployment.",
