    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates the test runner crashed before executing any tests. This represents a complete testing breakdown.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0.00% coverage** - No code was executed during testing. This is not a coverage gap but a complete testing system failure.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **health_check.py changes likely broke test infrastructure**\n2. Possible syntax errors preventing test discovery/import\n3. Test runner configuration issues\n4. Missing dependencies or imports in health_check.py\n5. Circular imports or module loading failures\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Fix test execution first** - Run tests with verbose output to identify the crash cause\n2. Check health_check.py for syntax errors: `python -m py_compile health_check.py`\n3. Verify test discovery: `python -m pytest --collect-only`\n4. Review recent changes to health_check.py for import/dependency issues\n5. Ensure test configuration files (pytest.ini, setup.cfg) are intact\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Code is completely untested and potentially broken. Deployment would be extremely risky. The entire test suite is non-operational, meaning no regression detection exists.\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
