    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1). No meaningful testing occurred. This indicates either catastrophic test infrastructure issues or severe code defects preventing test execution.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This represents a complete testing blackout, making it impossible to assess actual code quality or functionality.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n- **health_check.py changes likely introduced fatal errors** preventing test execution\n- Possible syntax errors, import failures, or runtime exceptions during module loading\n- Test environment/dependency issues triggered by the file changes\n- Test runner configuration may be broken\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. **Fix test execution first** - Run tests with verbose output to identify the root cause\n2. **Check health_check.py for syntax/runtime errors** - Validate the file can be imported\n3. **Verify test dependencies** - Ensure all required packages are installed\n4. **Run isolated test** - Test health_check.py independently to isolate the failure\n\n**FOLLOW-UP:**\n5. Add basic smoke tests to prevent complete test suite collapse\n6. Implement pre-commit hooks to catch syntax errors before testing\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deploying this code would be extremely dangerous:\n- Zero test validation of functionality\n- Unknown if health_check.py works at all\n- Potential production crashes or service outages\n- Complete loss of quality assurance\n\n**Priority: Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.**",
