    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code: -1) with 0% coverage. The test suite is non-functional and provides zero quality assurance.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **Total failure**: 0% coverage across all files\n- **No test execution**: Coverage data is empty, indicating tests didn't run at all\n- **Critical gap**: Entire codebase is untested in this run\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Breaking changes** in modified files likely caused test infrastructure failure\n2. **Configuration issues** in `tests/backend/conftest.py` may be preventing test execution\n3. **Dependency conflicts** - changes to `reliability/perplexity_client.py` and core engine files may have broken imports\n4. **Test infrastructure failure** - Exit code -1 suggests catastrophic failure before tests could execute\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. Run tests individually to isolate the breaking change:\n   ```bash\n   pytest tests/test_mtf_engine.py -v\n   pytest tests/backend/conftest.py -v\n   ```\n2. Check for syntax errors in modified Python files\n3. Verify all imports in changed files are valid\n4. Examine `conftest.py` for configuration errors\n\n**Short-term:**\n1. Add basic smoke tests to prevent complete test suite collapse\n2. Implement test isolation to prevent cascade failures\n3. Set up pre-commit hooks to catch syntax errors\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deployment would be extremely dangerous:\n- Zero test coverage means undetected bugs are guaranteed\n- Core engine changes (`mtf_engine.py`) are completely unvalidated\n- Database and integration changes are untested\n- No reliability metrics available for perplexity client\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
