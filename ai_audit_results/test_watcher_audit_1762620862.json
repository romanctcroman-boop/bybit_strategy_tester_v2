The test infrastructure itself is broken, making quality assessment impossible.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**COMPLETE COVERAGE FAILURE** - No code was executed during testing. All files show 0% coverage, indicating the test runner never reached actual test execution.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n- **conftest.py modification likely caused test infrastructure failure**\n- Possible issues: Syntax errors, import failures, fixture configuration errors\n- Test discovery/collection may be broken\n- Pytest configuration could be corrupted\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n1. **IMMEDIATE ACTION**: Revert `tests\\backend\\conftest.py` changes and verify test execution\n2. Run `pytest --collect-only` to diagnose test discovery issues\n3. Check for syntax errors in conftest.py: `python -m py_compile tests/backend/conftest.py`\n4. Verify pytest.ini/pyproject.toml configuration\n5. Run with `pytest -v` to see where execution fails\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - No tests are running, meaning:\n- All code changes are completely untested\n- Critical bugs could be deployed to production\n- Development is effectively flying blind\n- Immediate fix required before any further development\n\n**Priority**: Fix test infrastructure immediately before proceeding with any other work.",
