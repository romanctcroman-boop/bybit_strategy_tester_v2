This indicates severe infrastructure or environment issues, not test logic problems.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **0% coverage achieved** - No code was executed due to test harness failure\n- No coverage data available for analysis\n- Complete testing gap - unable to assess actual code coverage\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n- **Memory leak test file** (`test_memory_leaks.py`) likely contains fatal errors\n- Possible infinite loops or resource exhaustion in stress tests\n- Environment/dependency conflicts (missing packages, version mismatches)\n- Test framework configuration errors\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n1. **Immediate Action:**\n   - Isolate and run `test_memory_leaks.py` separately to identify crash source\n   - Add try-catch blocks and timeout mechanisms to stress tests\n   - Verify test environment setup and dependencies\n\n2. **Short-term:**\n   - Implement test suite segmentation (separate stress tests from unit tests)\n   - Add pre-flight checks for test environment validation\n   - Create smoke tests to validate test harness functionality\n\n3. **Long-term:**\n   - Establish test failure categorization (infrastructure vs. logic failures)\n   - Implement test isolation patterns to prevent cascade failures\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state provides zero confidence in code quality:\n- No functional validation occurring\n- Critical bugs could be undetected\n- Deployment blocking without meaningful feedback\n- Memory leak risks unverified despite being the focus area\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution infrastructure before addressing coverage gaps.",
