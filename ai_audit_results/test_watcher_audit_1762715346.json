This indicates either:\n- Syntax errors in test files or code\n- Missing dependencies/environment setup\n- Test framework configuration issues\n- Fatal errors during test discovery/import\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**ZERO COVERAGE** - 0.00% overall coverage suggests:\n- Tests didn't run at all due to execution failure\n- No meaningful test results to analyze\n- Complete testing gap across the codebase\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe modified `reliability\\mcp_manager.py` likely contains:\n- Syntax errors preventing import/execution\n- Breaking changes to class/method signatures\n- Missing imports or dependencies\n- Circular import issues\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Fix Test Execution First**\n   - Check Python syntax in all modified files\n   - Verify test dependencies are installed\n   - Run tests with `-v` flag to see specific failure points\n   - Ensure test discovery can import modules successfully\n\n2. **Validate MCP Manager Changes**\n   - Manually test `mcp_manager.py` imports\n   - Check for missing imports or undefined references\n   - Verify method signatures match usage\n\n3. **Restore Baseline**\n   - Get tests running before assessing coverage\n   - Start with minimal test case to verify execution\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deploying untested code with known test failures. The zero coverage and execution failure indicate the codebase may be in an unstable state. Without passing tests, reliability cannot be verified.\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
