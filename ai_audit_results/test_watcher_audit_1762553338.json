This indicates either:\n- Syntax errors in test files or code\n- Missing dependencies/environment setup\n- Test framework configuration issues\n- Fatal errors during test discovery/import\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**ZERO COVERAGE** - 0.00% coverage across all files indicates:\n- No tests actually ran successfully\n- Recent changes likely broke test execution entirely\n- Cannot assess actual code coverage due to test failure\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe changed files suggest:\n1. **`secure_key_storage.py`** - Security-related changes may have introduced import/initialization issues\n2. **`lru_ttl_cache.py`** - Caching logic changes could cause circular imports or initialization failures\n3. **`analyze_final_v2_with_deepseek.py`** - New analysis script may have broken test environment\n\n## Immediate Action Items\n1. **Fix Test Execution First**\n   - Check test runner logs for specific error details\n   - Verify all imports work (run `python -m pytest --collect-only`)\n   - Ensure test dependencies are installed\n\n2. **Validate Recent Changes**\n   - Test each changed file in isolation\n   - Check for circular imports between security and cache modules\n   - Verify new analysis script doesn't interfere with test environment\n\n3. **Quick Wins**\n   - Run tests on individual files to identify the breaking change\n   - Revert recent changes temporarily to confirm working baseline\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deploying with broken tests is extremely dangerous:\n- No validation of security changes in key storage\n- Cache logic changes untested\n- Potential regression in core API functionality\n- Security vulnerabilities could be introduced\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
