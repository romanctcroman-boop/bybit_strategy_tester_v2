    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test suite failed to execute (Exit Code -1). No meaningful testing occurred. This indicates either:\n- Syntax errors in test files or application code\n- Missing dependencies or environment issues\n- Test framework configuration problems\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% coverage** - No code was executed during testing. This is a direct result of the test execution failure, not an actual measurement of test coverage.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe failure likely relates to changes in `backend\\api\\app.py`:\n- Syntax errors introduced in the recent commit\n- Breaking changes to imports or dependencies\n- Missing required modules or configuration\n\n## Recommendations\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. **Fix test execution** - Run tests locally to identify the specific error causing exit code -1\n2. **Check syntax** - Validate `backend\\api\\app.py` for Python syntax compliance\n3. **Verify dependencies** - Ensure all required packages are installed and compatible\n\n**Follow-up:**\n4. Add pre-commit hooks to catch syntax errors before pushing\n5. Implement basic smoke tests that run before full test suite\n6. Set up CI pipeline to run tests on all commits\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deploying without functioning tests poses significant risk:\n- Undetected runtime errors in production\n- Regression issues from recent changes\n- Complete lack of quality assurance\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
