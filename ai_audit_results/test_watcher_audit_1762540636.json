This indicates a fundamental problem in the test environment or test code itself, not just test failures.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% coverage** - No code was executed successfully. This is a direct result of the test crash, not a coverage measurement issue.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe stress test `test_parallel_execution.py` likely contains:\n- Infinite loops or resource exhaustion\n- Memory leaks causing system crashes\n- Race conditions leading to deadlocks\n- Missing error handling for edge cases\n- Environment configuration issues\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n\n1. **Debug the Crash First**\n   ```bash\n   python -m pytest tests/stress/test_parallel_execution.py -v --tb=short\n   ```\n   Run with minimal parallelism to identify the crash point.\n\n2. **Add Safe Guards**\n   - Implement timeout decorators\n   - Add resource monitoring (memory, CPU)\n   - Include graceful degradation for stress conditions\n\n3. **Isolate and Fix**\n   - Test the stress module in isolation\n   - Add incremental complexity with smaller test cases\n   - Verify environment can handle the load\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - This crash indicates unstable test infrastructure that could mask real product issues. No reliable quality signals are being generated until resolved.\n\n**Priority:** Fix this immediately before any further testing or deployment.",
