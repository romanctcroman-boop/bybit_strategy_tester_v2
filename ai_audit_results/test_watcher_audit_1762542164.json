    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test suite failed to execute (Exit Code -1). No meaningful testing occurred. This indicates either:\n- Syntax errors in test files or code\n- Missing dependencies/environment setup\n- Test framework configuration issues\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% coverage** - No code was executed during testing. This is a direct result of test execution failure, not a coverage gap issue.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n- `demo_prometheus_metrics.py` changes likely introduced breaking changes\n- Possible import errors, syntax issues, or dependency conflicts\n- Test environment may lack required Prometheus client library\n\n## Immediate Action Items\n1. **Fix Test Execution First**\n   - Check test runner logs for specific error messages\n   - Verify Python syntax in both test files and `demo_prometheus_metrics.py`\n   - Ensure `prometheus_client` is installed in test environment\n\n2. **Validate Basic Functionality**\n   - Run simple import test: `python -c \"import demo_prometheus_metrics\"`\n   - Check for missing imports or circular dependencies\n\n3. **Restore Test Infrastructure**\n   - Run a minimal passing test to verify framework works\n   - Gradually reintroduce actual test cases\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deploying without functioning tests poses significant reliability risk. The codebase is currently untested and may contain runtime errors that won't be caught until production.\n\n## Priority Recommendation\n**Fix test execution immediately** before any further development or deployment. Without working tests, all other quality metrics are meaningless.",
