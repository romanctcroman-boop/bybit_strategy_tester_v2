No tests ran successfully, indicating fundamental issues with the test suite or environment setup.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code coverage was collected, which means:\n- Tests failed before any meaningful execution\n- No production code was exercised\n- Complete lack of visibility into what code paths work\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe modified file `tests/test_safe_async_bridge_simple.py` likely contains:\n- Syntax errors preventing test discovery/execution\n- Import failures or missing dependencies\n- Configuration issues in test setup\n- Runtime exceptions during test collection\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. **Fix test execution first** - Run tests with `-v` flag to see which specific test fails\n2. **Check test file syntax** - Validate Python syntax in the modified test file\n3. **Verify imports** - Ensure all imports resolve correctly\n4. **Run minimal test** - Create a simple passing test to verify test framework works\n\n**FOLLOW-UP:**\n5. Add test discovery verification to CI pipeline\n6. Implement basic smoke tests that run before full test suite\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state provides zero confidence in code quality:\n- No regression detection capability\n- Potential production bugs undetected\n- Deployment would be completely blind\n- Urgent fix required before any further development\n\n**Priority: Fix immediately** - Test infrastructure must be restored before addressing any other issues.",
