    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1), indicating fundamental issues with the test suite or environment setup. No meaningful quality assessment possible until basic execution is resolved.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% coverage** - All tests failed to execute, making coverage data meaningless. The entire codebase is effectively untested.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Broken test infrastructure** - Exit code -1 suggests system-level failure (segmentation fault, memory issues, or environment problems)\n2. **Dependency conflicts** - Recent changes to `test_deepseek_tools.py` may have introduced incompatible dependencies\n3. **Import/circular dependency issues** - Test module may fail to import required components\n4. **Environment configuration** - Missing environment variables, corrupted virtual environment, or Python interpreter issues\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. Run tests with `-v` flag to see which specific test fails first\n2. Check Python environment integrity: `python --version` and `pip list`\n3. Run a simple smoke test to verify basic Python functionality\n4. Examine recent changes to `test_deepseek_tools.py` for obvious syntax errors\n\n**FOLLOW-UP:**\n5. Isolate the failing test and run it individually\n6. Check for system resource issues (memory, disk space)\n7. Verify all test dependencies are properly installed\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - The complete test failure means:\n- No regression protection for any code changes\n- Potential deployment of broken code to production\n- Unknown stability of the entire application\n- Critical need to resolve before any further development\n\n**Priority: Fix test execution immediately before addressing any other issues.**",
