    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (exit code -1) with zero coverage. This indicates either a catastrophic test infrastructure failure or severe code defects preventing test execution.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **Total Coverage: 0%** - No code was executed during testing\n- **No coverage data available** - Test framework failed before collecting metrics\n- **Critical gap**: Unable to assess actual code coverage due to execution failure\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Integration test failure** in `test_multi_key_rotation.py` likely contains:\n   - Syntax errors or import failures\n   - Environment/dependency issues (missing modules, configuration)\n   - Infinite loops or resource exhaustion\n   - Test framework compatibility problems\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. **Debug the failing test** - Run `test_multi_key_rotation.py` in isolation with verbose output\n2. **Check test dependencies** - Verify all required packages and environment variables\n3. **Review recent commits** - Examine changes to the integration test file specifically\n\n**Process Improvements:**\n4. Implement test isolation - Ensure failing tests don't block entire test suite\n5. Add pre-commit test validation to catch syntax errors early\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- No reliable test feedback on code quality\n- Potential production issues undetected\n- Broken CI/CD pipeline\n- Development blocked until resolved\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
