No tests ran successfully, indicating either:\n- Syntax errors in test files or code\n- Missing dependencies/environment setup\n- Test framework configuration issues\n- Fatal errors during test discovery/import\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**ZERO COVERAGE** - 0.00% overall coverage confirms no tests executed. The coverage report is empty, suggesting the test run terminated before any coverage data could be collected.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe modified file `backend\\api\\parallel_deepseek_client_v2.py` likely contains:\n- **Syntax errors** preventing import/execution\n- **Missing imports** or dependencies\n- **Breaking changes** to class/method signatures\n- **Configuration issues** in the client implementation\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Fix Test Execution First**\n   - Check test runner logs for specific error messages\n   - Verify Python syntax in the modified file\n   - Ensure all imports and dependencies are available\n\n2. **Validate the Modified Client**\n   ```python\n   # Quick syntax check\n   python -m py_compile backend/api/parallel_deepseek_client_v2.py\n   ```\n\n3. **Isolate the Issue**\n   - Run tests on individual files to identify the breaking point\n   - Check for circular imports or initialization issues\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deploying this code would be extremely risky because:\n- No functionality has been validated\n- The client modification may have introduced critical bugs\n- Zero test coverage means unknown regression impact\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
