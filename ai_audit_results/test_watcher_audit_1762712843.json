    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1). No tests ran successfully, indicating either:\n- Syntax errors in test code\n- Import failures\n- Fixture/setup configuration errors\n- Environment issues\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This is a direct result of the test execution failure.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe file `fix_error_handling_tests.py` likely contains:\n- Syntax errors preventing test discovery/execution\n- Broken imports or dependencies\n- Invalid test structure (missing classes/functions)\n- Configuration errors in test setup/teardown\n\n## Recommendations\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. **Fix test execution first** - Run tests with verbose output to identify the specific failure point\n2. **Check syntax** - Validate `fix_error_handling_tests.py` for Python syntax compliance\n3. **Verify imports** - Ensure all required modules and dependencies are available\n4. **Test isolation** - Run this test file individually to isolate the issue\n\n**Follow-up:**\n5. Once tests execute, implement proper error handling test cases\n6. Add coverage for exception paths and edge cases\n7. Include both unit and integration tests for error scenarios\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state provides zero confidence in code quality. Without functioning tests:\n- Undetected regressions are certain\n- Error handling logic remains untested\n- Deployment would be extremely risky\n- Team cannot validate fixes or new features\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development.",
