    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely unhandled exception or environment crash). No tests executed successfully.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This represents complete testing failure, not just poor coverage.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n- **Server.py modifications** likely introduced fatal errors preventing test execution\n- Possible causes: Syntax errors, import failures, infinite loops, or environment dependency breaks\n- Test runner cannot even initialize or import modules\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Fix Test Execution First**\n   - Run tests with `-v` flag to see specific failure point\n   - Check server.py for syntax errors: `python -m py_compile mcp-server/server.py`\n   - Verify imports and dependencies are intact\n\n2. **Debug Sequence**\n   - Run minimal test: `python -c \"from mcp-server import server\"`\n   - Check for circular imports or missing dependencies\n   - Ensure test configuration files are valid\n\n3. **Restore Baseline**\n   - Revert server.py changes if recent\n   - Add basic smoke test that verifies module can import\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Production deployment would fail. No validation of server functionality exists. Code changes cannot be safely merged until basic test execution is restored.\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development.",
