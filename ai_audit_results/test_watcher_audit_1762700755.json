    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1). No tests ran successfully, indicating either:\n- Syntax errors in test files or code\n- Configuration issues in test runner\n- Critical exceptions during test setup\n- Missing dependencies or environment issues\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% coverage** - This is a severe regression. The recent changes likely broke the test execution pipeline entirely.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe modified files suggest:\n1. **`health_check.py`** - Possible breaking changes in health check logic or imports\n2. **`circuit_breaker.py`** - Potential issues with circuit breaker pattern implementation causing test crashes\n\n## Immediate Actions Required\n1. **Fix Test Execution First**\n   - Check for syntax errors in both changed files\n   - Verify imports and dependencies\n   - Run tests individually to isolate the failure point\n\n2. **Debug Priority Order**\n   - Start with `health_check.py` - often contains critical initialization code\n   - Then `circuit_breaker.py` - circuit breakers can cause silent failures\n\n3. **Quick Diagnostics**\n   ```bash\n   python -m py_compile health_check.py\n   python -m py_compile backend/core/circuit_breaker.py\n   python -c \"import health_check\"  # Test imports\n   ```\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Cannot deploy with 0% test coverage and failing test execution. The codebase is currently untested and potentially broken.\n\n## Recommendations\n1. **Immediate**: Fix test execution before addressing coverage\n2. **Short-term**: Add basic smoke tests for health checks and circuit breaker\n3. **Long-term**: Implement CI checks to prevent 0% coverage scenarios\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution → Add basic coverage → Expand test suite",
