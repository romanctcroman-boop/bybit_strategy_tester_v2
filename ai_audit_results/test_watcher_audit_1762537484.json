    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely unhandled exception or system error). No tests executed successfully.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0.00% coverage** - No code was executed during testing. This represents complete test infrastructure failure rather than just poor coverage.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **audit_agent.py changes likely broke test execution**\n2. Possible causes:\n   - Syntax errors preventing import\n   - Missing dependencies in test environment\n   - Infinite loops or blocking operations\n   - Test runner configuration issues\n   - Critical exceptions during module import\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. Run tests with `-v` flag to see specific failure details\n2. Check Python syntax: `python -m py_compile automation\\task3_audit_agent\\audit_agent.py`\n3. Verify imports and dependencies are available in test environment\n4. Add try-catch blocks around test setup to capture initialization errors\n\n**Short-term:**\n1. Implement basic smoke test to verify module can be imported\n2. Add test logging to capture failure context\n3. Set up test isolation to prevent environment contamination\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- No reliable test feedback mechanism\n- Potential production issues undetectable\n- Complete loss of quality assurance\n- Deployment would be extremely risky\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
