    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely unhandled exception or environment crash). Zero coverage confirms no tests executed successfully.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**100% GAP** - No code coverage achieved. Critical files (`task_queue.py` and its tests) are completely untested in this execution.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Breaking changes** in `task_queue.py` likely causing import failures or runtime crashes\n2. **Test infrastructure failure** - test runner cannot execute any tests\n3. **Dependency issues** - missing imports or incompatible changes\n4. **Syntax errors** in modified files preventing execution\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. Run tests locally with verbose output to identify the root crash cause\n2. Check for syntax errors in both `task_queue.py` and `test_task_queue.py`\n3. Verify imports and dependencies between changed files\n4. Add basic smoke test to ensure test infrastructure works\n\n**FOLLOW-UP:**\n- Implement minimal passing test before adding features\n- Set up pre-commit hooks to catch syntax errors\n- Add logging to test setup to diagnose initialization failures\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deployment would be completely untested. Recent changes have broken the entire test suite, indicating potential:\n- Runtime crashes in production\n- Integration failures\n- Data corruption risks\n- Service unavailability\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
