    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1) with 0% coverage, indicating fundamental issues in the test environment or codebase.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **Total failure**: 0% coverage across all files\n- **No data available** for individual file coverage\n- **Critical gap**: Tests aren't even executing successfully\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Memory leak tests** (`test_memory_leaks.py`) likely causing test runner crashes\n2. **Async bridge implementation** (`safe_async_bridge.py`) may have blocking/deadlock issues\n3. **Environment configuration** problems preventing test execution\n4. **Resource exhaustion** from stress tests overwhelming system\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions (Next 24 hours):**\n1. Run tests individually to isolate the crashing component\n2. Add timeout protection to memory leak tests\n3. Check async bridge for proper error handling and resource cleanup\n4. Verify test dependencies and environment setup\n\n**Short-term (Next week):**\n1. Implement test execution monitoring with resource limits\n2. Add basic smoke tests before running full test suite\n3. Create isolated test environments for stress testing\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- Production code changes cannot be validated\n- Potential memory/resource leaks in production\n- Async operations may have stability issues\n- No safety net for recent changes to critical components\n\n**Priority**: Address test execution failures before any further development on affected components.",
