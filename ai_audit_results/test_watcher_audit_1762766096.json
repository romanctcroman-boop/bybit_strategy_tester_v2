    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1), indicating fundamental issues with either test infrastructure or code syntax/runtime errors.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing, suggesting:\n- Tests cannot run due to fatal errors\n- Test discovery/import failures\n- Critical runtime exceptions before test execution\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe modified `auto_diagnostic_system.py` likely contains:\n- Syntax errors preventing import/execution\n- Fatal runtime exceptions during module loading\n- Broken imports or dependencies\n- Infinite loops or blocking operations during initialization\n\n## Recommendations\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. **Debug test execution failure first** - Check test runner logs for specific error messages\n2. **Validate syntax** - Run `python -m py_compile auto_diagnostic_system.py`\n3. **Test module import** - Attempt `import auto_diagnostic_system` in Python shell\n4. **Check for initialization errors** - Look for code executing at module level that could crash\n\n**FOLLOW-UP:**\n- Add basic smoke tests that verify module can be imported\n- Implement error handling for module-level code\n- Set up pre-commit hooks to catch syntax errors\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Production deployment would likely fail completely. The system is currently non-functional and untested. All changes to `auto_diagnostic_system.py` should be considered potentially breaking until basic test execution is restored.\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution failure before addressing coverage or adding new tests.",
