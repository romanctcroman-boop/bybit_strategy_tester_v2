    "analysis": "Based on the test results, here are the key insights:\n\n## 1. Test Quality Assessment\n**Critical Failure** - Tests are completely broken:\n- Exit code -1 indicates abnormal termination (segmentation fault, memory error, or fatal Python error)\n- No tests executed successfully\n- Likely environment or dependency issues preventing test execution\n\n## 2. Coverage Analysis\n**Complete Failure** - 0% coverage means:\n- No code was executed during testing\n- Tests cannot run or crash immediately\n- Coverage instrumentation failed to collect any data\n\n## 3. Potential Issues\n**Recent changes likely introduced fatal errors:**\n- Circuit breaker implementation may have infinite recursion or memory leaks\n- Import cycles between test and implementation files\n- Missing dependencies or incompatible versions\n- Syntax errors or runtime exceptions preventing module loading\n\n## 4. Immediate Recommendations\n**Priority fixes required:**\n1. **Debug test execution** - Run tests with `-v` flag to see where they fail\n2. **Check imports** - Verify no circular imports between test and implementation\n3. **Validate syntax** - Ensure both files can be imported independently\n4. **Add basic smoke test** - Create minimal test that imports modules without executing logic\n\n## 5. Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- Production code may be completely broken\n- No validation of circuit breaker functionality\n- Potential for runtime crashes in production\n- Zero confidence in recent changes\n\n**Immediate action required** - Fix test execution before any further development or deployment.",
