    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1). No meaningful test quality can be assessed since tests didn't run successfully. This indicates fundamental issues with the test environment, dependencies, or test code structure.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% coverage** - No code was executed during testing. This represents a complete testing gap across the entire codebase. The empty coverage report suggests either:\n- Test framework configuration errors\n- Test discovery failures\n- Critical runtime exceptions before test execution\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe modified file `full_ai_audit_deepseek_perplexity_deepseek.py` likely contains:\n- Syntax errors preventing import/execution\n- Missing dependencies or imports\n- Configuration changes breaking test setup\n- Runtime errors in module-level code\n\n## Immediate Action Recommendations\n1. **Debug Exit Code -1**: Check test runner logs for stack traces and error messages\n2. **Verify Test Configuration**: Ensure pytest/unittest configuration files are valid\n3. **Check Dependencies**: Validate all required packages are installed and compatible\n4. **Isolate the Problem**: Test the changed file in isolation to identify specific issues\n5. **Add Basic Smoke Test**: Create a minimal test that verifies the module can be imported\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- No reliable testing feedback loop\n- Potential for undetected regressions\n- Possible deployment of broken code\n- Complete lack of quality assurance\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
