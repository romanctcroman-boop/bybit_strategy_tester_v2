The test suite is non-functional and provides zero quality assurance.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **Total failure**: 0% coverage across all files\n- **No test execution**: Coverage data is empty, indicating tests didn't run at all\n- **Critical gap**: Entire codebase is untested in this run\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Breaking changes** in modified files likely caused test infrastructure failure\n2. **Configuration issues** in `tests/backend/conftest.py` may be preventing test execution\n3. **Dependency problems** - changes to `reliability/perplexity_client.py` or database components may have broken imports\n4. **Test framework corruption** - conftest modifications could have disrupted pytest setup\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Fix test execution first**:\n   - Run `pytest -v` to identify specific failure points\n   - Check `conftest.py` for configuration errors\n   - Verify all dependencies are available\n\n2. **Isolate the break**:\n   - Test individual files: `pytest tests/unit/test_batch_writer.py -v`\n   - Check for import errors in modified modules\n\n3. **Restore basic functionality**:\n   - Fix any syntax errors in modified Python files\n   - Ensure test database connections work\n   - Verify external service clients initialize properly\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deployment would be extremely dangerous:\n- No working test suite means undetected regressions are guaranteed\n- 0% coverage indicates potential runtime errors in production\n- Recent changes to core engine and reliability components are completely unvalidated\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
