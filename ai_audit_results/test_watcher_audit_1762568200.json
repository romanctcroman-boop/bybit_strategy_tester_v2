    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1) with 0% coverage. The test infrastructure itself is broken, making quality assessment impossible.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**COMPLETE COVERAGE FAILURE** - No code was executed during testing. All coverage metrics show 0%, indicating the test runner cannot even initialize.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n- **conftest.py modifications** are the primary suspect - this file handles test configuration and fixtures\n- Likely causes:\n  - Syntax errors in conftest.py\n  - Missing imports or dependencies\n  - Broken fixture definitions\n  - Configuration conflicts\n  - Environment setup failures\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. **Debug conftest.py** - Check for syntax errors and runtime issues\n2. **Run pytest with `-v` flag** to see specific error messages\n3. **Test isolation** - Run `pytest tests/backend/conftest.py` directly\n4. **Check pytest configuration** in pyproject.toml/pytest.ini\n\n**FOLLOW-UP:**\n5. Add basic smoke test to verify test infrastructure\n6. Implement CI pipeline validation for test configuration changes\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - \n- No test validation of actual code\n- Undetected regressions likely\n- Deployment blocking without test feedback\n- Entire test suite is non-functional\n\n**Priority: Fix immediately** - Test infrastructure must be restored before any further development or deployment.",
