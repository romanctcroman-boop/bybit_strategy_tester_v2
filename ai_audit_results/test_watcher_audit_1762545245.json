    "analysis": "Based on the test results, here are the key insights:\n\n## 1. Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely broken\n- Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic test failure (likely unhandled exceptions)\n- Zero test execution suggests fundamental infrastructure issues\n- No meaningful quality assessment possible until basic test execution is restored\n\n## 2. Coverage Analysis\n**0% coverage indicates:**\n- Tests aren't running at all\n- Possible causes: database connection failures, import errors, configuration issues\n- Migration files suggest database schema changes that may have broken test setup\n\n## 3. Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n**Migration-related risks:**\n- Multiple migration files (`perf_indexes_001`, `add_reasoning_kb_001`, `merge_all_heads`)\n- Database schema inconsistencies between test and development environments\n- Possible migration dependency conflicts or missing dependencies\n\n## 4. Immediate Recommendations\n\n**Priority 1 - Restore Test Execution:**\n```bash\n# Check test database connectivity\n# Verify migration state matches between environments\n# Run tests with verbose output to identify root cause\npython -m pytest -v --tb=short\n```\n\n**Priority 2 - Infrastructure Fixes:**\n- Verify test database is properly migrated and seeded\n- Check environment variables and configuration files\n- Ensure all migration dependencies are satisfied\n\n**Priority 3 - Prevention:**\n- Add pre-commit hooks to verify test execution\n- Implement database state validation in CI/CD\n- Add migration rollback tests\n\n## 5. Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state prevents deployment\n- No confidence in code changes due to complete test failure\n- Migration changes could introduce production database issues\n- Potential data integrity risks from untested schema changes\n\n**Immediate Action Required:** Fix test infrastructure before any further development or deployment.",
