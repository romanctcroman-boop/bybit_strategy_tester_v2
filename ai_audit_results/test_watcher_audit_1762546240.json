    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1). No meaningful quality assessment possible as tests didn't run to completion. This indicates fundamental issues with the test infrastructure or environment.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This is not a coverage gap but a complete test execution failure.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **health_check.py changes likely broke test execution**\n2. Possible causes:\n   - Syntax errors in health_check.py\n   - Missing dependencies or imports\n   - Infinite loops or blocking operations\n   - Environment configuration issues\n   - Test runner configuration broken\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. Run `python -m py_compile health_check.py` to check for syntax errors\n2. Execute tests with verbose output: `pytest -vvs` to identify failure point\n3. Check test dependencies and environment setup\n4. Verify health_check.py doesn't contain infinite loops or blocking I/O\n\n**FOLLOW-UP:**\n1. Add pre-commit hooks to catch syntax errors\n2. Implement basic smoke tests before full test suite\n3. Set up CI pipeline with dependency validation\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Production deployment would be extremely risky:\n- No validation that code changes work\n- Unknown if health_check.py functions correctly\n- Potential for runtime errors in production\n- No regression protection\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
