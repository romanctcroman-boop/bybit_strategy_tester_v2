No tests ran successfully, indicating either:\n- Syntax errors in test files or code\n- Missing dependencies/environment setup\n- Test framework configuration issues\n- Fatal errors during test discovery/import\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This is a direct result of test execution failure, not a coverage measurement issue.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n- `health_check.py` modifications likely introduced breaking changes\n- Possible import errors, syntax errors, or runtime exceptions\n- Missing dependencies or environment variables\n- Test infrastructure may be broken\n\n## Recommendations\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. **Fix test execution** - Check test runner configuration and resolve fatal errors\n2. **Validate `health_check.py`** - Review recent changes for syntax/logical errors\n3. **Run basic syntax check** - `python -m py_compile health_check.py`\n4. **Test import isolation** - `python -c \"import health_check\"`\n\n**Follow-up:**\n5. Restore basic test execution before addressing coverage\n6. Add smoke tests to prevent complete test suite failure\n7. Implement CI pipeline with pre-commit syntax validation\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deploying this code would be extremely risky because:\n- No validation of recent changes in `health_check.py`\n- Unknown if core functionality works\n- Potential for runtime failures in production\n- Zero test feedback on code quality\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
