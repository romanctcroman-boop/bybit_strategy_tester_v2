    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely unhandled exception or environment crash). Zero coverage suggests tests never executed properly.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **Total Coverage: 0%** - No code was executed during testing\n- **No file-specific coverage data** - Test framework failed before collecting metrics\n- **Critical Gap**: Unable to assess actual code coverage due to test infrastructure failure\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Robot.py or advanced_architecture.py changes** likely introduced:\n   - Fatal import errors or circular dependencies\n   - Syntax errors preventing module loading\n   - Environment configuration breaks\n   - Critical exceptions in module initialization\n\n2. **Test infrastructure may be broken** by:\n   - Missing dependencies in changed files\n   - Configuration changes affecting test runner\n   - Resource conflicts or permission issues\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Fix Test Execution First**:\n   ```bash\n   # Isolate the failure\n   python -m pytest automation/ --tb=short -v\n   # Check specific modules\n   python -c \"from automation.deepseek_robot import robot\"\n   ```\n\n2. **Debug Steps**:\n   - Verify Python environment and dependencies\n   - Check for syntax errors in changed files\n   - Test imports individually\n   - Review recent commit changes for obvious breaks\n\n3. **Add Safety Nets**:\n   - Implement basic smoke tests that run before full test suite\n   - Add module-level try/except for better error reporting\n   - Consider pre-commit hooks to catch syntax issues\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- No reliable testing feedback\n- Potential production-breaking changes undetected\n- Development blocked until test infrastructure restored\n- High probability of undetected regressions\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
