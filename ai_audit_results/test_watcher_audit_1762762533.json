    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1). No meaningful testing occurred. This indicates either:\n- Syntax errors in test files or code\n- Missing dependencies/environment setup\n- Test framework configuration issues\n- Fatal errors during test discovery/import\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This is a direct result of the test execution failure, not an actual coverage measurement.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe file `simple_audit_request.py` likely contains:\n- Syntax errors preventing import/execution\n- Missing imports or dependencies\n- Circular imports\n- Code that crashes during module initialization\n\n## Recommendations\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. **Fix test execution first** - Run tests with verbose output to identify the specific failure point\n2. **Check syntax** - Validate `simple_audit_request.py` for basic Python syntax compliance\n3. **Verify imports** - Ensure all dependencies are available in test environment\n4. **Test isolation** - Run tests for this specific file alone to isolate the issue\n\n**Technical Steps:**\n```bash\npython -m py_compile simple_audit_request.py  # Check syntax\npython -c \"import simple_audit_request\"       # Test import\npytest simple_audit_request.py -v             # Detailed test output\n```\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - The codebase is currently untestable and potentially broken. No quality metrics can be trusted until basic test execution is restored. Deployment of this code would be extremely risky.\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any other development continues.",
