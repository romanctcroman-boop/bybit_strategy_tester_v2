No meaningful quality assessment possible as zero tests executed successfully.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% COVERAGE** - Complete coverage failure suggests:\n- Test environment not properly initialized\n- Dependencies missing or incompatible\n- Critical configuration errors\n- Test discovery/execution framework broken\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe single changed file `tests/integration/test_e2e_test_watcher.py` likely contains:\n- Syntax errors preventing import/execution\n- Missing imports or dependencies\n- Infinite loops or resource exhaustion\n- Environment-specific assumptions that failed\n- Integration with broken external systems\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. **Debug test execution** - Check test runner logs for crash details\n2. **Isolate the failing test** - Run this specific test file independently\n3. **Validate test environment** - Verify all dependencies and configurations\n4. **Add test discovery verification** - Ensure tests are being collected properly\n\n**FOLLOW-UP:**\n5. Implement pre-commit test validation\n6. Add health checks for test infrastructure\n7. Create smoke tests for critical integration points\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Complete test failure means:\n- No confidence in any code changes\n- Potential undiscovered regressions\n- Deployment blockers until resolved\n- Possible production issues if deployed without testing\n\n**Priority:** Resolve immediately before any further development or deployment.",
