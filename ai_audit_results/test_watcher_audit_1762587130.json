    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1). No tests ran successfully, indicating fundamental infrastructure or configuration issues rather than test logic problems.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This represents a complete testing blackout, making it impossible to assess actual code quality or functionality.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe single changed file (`tests\\backend\\conftest.py`) suggests:\n- **Pytest configuration corruption** - Likely syntax errors, import failures, or fixture conflicts\n- **Environment setup failure** - Database connections, environment variables, or dependency issues\n- **Hook function errors** - Broken setup/teardown logic preventing test discovery/execution\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. **Debug conftest.py** - Check for syntax errors, missing imports, or infinite loops\n2. **Run pytest with `-v` flag** - Get detailed error output to identify root cause\n3. **Verify pytest.ini/pyproject.toml** - Ensure configuration files are valid\n4. **Test isolation** - Temporarily rename conftest.py to confirm it's the culprit\n\n**FOLLOW-UP:**\n- Add pre-commit hooks to validate pytest configuration\n- Implement basic smoke tests for test infrastructure\n- Monitor test execution time for potential hangs\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state provides zero confidence in code quality. Any deployment would be blind to:\n- Breaking changes in production code\n- Regression defects\n- Integration failures\n\n**Priority: CRITICAL** - Must be resolved before any further development or deployment activities.",
