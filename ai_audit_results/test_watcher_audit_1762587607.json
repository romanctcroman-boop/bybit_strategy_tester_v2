    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1). No meaningful quality assessment possible as tests didn't run to completion. This indicates either catastrophic test infrastructure issues or severe code defects preventing test execution.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This represents a complete testing failure, not just gaps in coverage.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Syntax/Import Errors** in `ai_integrations.py` likely preventing module import\n2. **Missing Dependencies** - Required packages may not be installed\n3. **Runtime Exceptions** during module initialization\n4. **Test Configuration Issues** - Test runner may be misconfigured\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. Run `python -m py_compile automation\\deepseek_robot\\ai_integrations.py` to check for syntax errors\n2. Execute tests with `-v` flag to see specific failure details\n3. Check test runner configuration and dependencies\n4. Verify Python environment and path settings\n\n**FOLLOW-UP:**\n- Add basic smoke test to verify module can be imported\n- Implement CI pipeline with dependency validation\n- Add static analysis (pylint, mypy) to catch issues pre-execution\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Code is completely untested and potentially non-functional. Deployment would be extremely risky. The -1 exit code suggests fundamental issues that could impact system stability.\n\n**Priority:** Resolve test execution failure before any other quality improvements.",
