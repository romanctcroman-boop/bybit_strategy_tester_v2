No tests ran successfully, indicating fundamental issues with the test infrastructure or environment setup.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% coverage** across all files - This is a complete testing failure, not just low coverage. No code was executed during test runs.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe modified `tests\\backend\\conftest.py` file is likely the root cause:\n- **Fixture failures** - Critical pytest fixtures may be broken\n- **Import errors** - Missing dependencies or incorrect imports\n- **Configuration errors** - Environment setup or teardown failures\n- **Syntax errors** - Invalid Python code preventing test discovery\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n1. **Immediate Actions:**\n   - Fix `conftest.py` syntax/import issues\n   - Run `pytest -v` to identify specific failure points\n   - Check Python/pytest version compatibility\n\n2. **Short-term:**\n   - Add basic smoke tests for test infrastructure\n   - Implement CI pipeline that fails fast on configuration issues\n   - Validate fixture dependencies\n\n3. **Long-term:**\n   - Add test health checks to prevent silent failures\n   - Monitor test execution patterns for early detection\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state provides zero confidence in code quality. Without functioning tests:\n- Undetected regressions likely in production\n- No safety net for code changes\n- Deployment carries significant business risk\n\n**Priority:** Fix test infrastructure immediately before any further development.",
