    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates a fatal error during test execution, likely preventing any tests from running.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code coverage data collected. This suggests:\n- Test runner crashed before collecting coverage\n- Possible import errors or environment issues\n- No actual test execution occurred\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Import/Circular Dependencies** - Changes in `safe_async_bridge.py` may have broken imports in test file\n2. **Syntax Errors** - Recent modifications could contain Python syntax errors\n3. **Missing Dependencies** - New imports without corresponding requirements\n4. **Environment Configuration** - Test environment may be misconfigured\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. Run tests with `-v` flag to see specific failure details\n2. Check Python version compatibility\n3. Verify all imports in both test and implementation files\n4. Run `python -m py_compile` on both changed files to check for syntax errors\n\n**FOLLOW-UP:**\n- Add basic smoke test to verify test infrastructure\n- Implement CI pipeline with dependency installation\n- Add static analysis (pylint, mypy) to catch issues pre-commit\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- No reliable test feedback mechanism\n- Potential production bugs undetected\n- Development blocked until root cause identified\n- All recent changes effectively untested\n\n**Priority:** Resolve test execution failure before any further development.",
