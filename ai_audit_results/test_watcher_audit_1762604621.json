No tests executed successfully.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% coverage** across all files means:\n- Zero test execution occurred\n- Recent changes likely broke the test runner itself\n- No meaningful coverage data available for analysis\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe file `automation\\deepseek_robot\\advanced_architecture.py` likely contains:\n- Syntax errors preventing import/execution\n- Missing dependencies or imports\n- Infinite loops or memory issues crashing the test runner\n- Environment configuration conflicts\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. **Fix test runner crash** - Run tests with verbose output to identify the root cause\n2. **Validate syntax** - Check `advanced_architecture.py` for basic Python syntax errors\n3. **Isolate the issue** - Temporarily remove/revert the changed file to confirm it's the culprit\n4. **Add basic smoke test** - Create a minimal test that imports the module to catch import-time failures\n\n**Short-term:**\n- Implement try/catch around test initialization\n- Add pre-commit hooks for syntax validation\n- Create environment sanity checks\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- No regression protection\n- Potential production issues undetected\n- Development blocked until resolved\n- Entire test suite compromised\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution before any further development. The inability to run tests poses existential risk to code quality and deployment safety.",
