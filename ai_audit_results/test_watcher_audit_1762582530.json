    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely uncaught exception or system error). Zero coverage confirms no tests executed successfully.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **Total coverage: 0%** - No code was executed during testing\n- **No coverage data available** - Test framework failed before collecting metrics\n- **Critical gap**: Entire codebase is untested in this execution\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe modified files suggest:\n1. **`timeout_config.py` changes** likely introduced fatal configuration errors\n2. **Circuit breaker tests** may be causing test harness crashes\n3. **Possible issues**: Infinite loops, import errors, environment dependencies, or configuration syntax errors\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. Run tests with `-v` flag to see which specific test fails first\n2. Check for syntax errors in `timeout_config.py`\n3. Verify all imports in both changed files\n4. Test circuit breaker logic in isolation\n\n**Short-term:**\n1. Add try-catch blocks in test setup to capture exceptions\n2. Implement basic smoke tests before full test suite\n3. Add configuration validation in `timeout_config.py`\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- Production deployments would be blind to regressions\n- Circuit breaker functionality (critical for resilience) is untested\n- Configuration changes could break entire application\n- Zero confidence in recent changes\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
