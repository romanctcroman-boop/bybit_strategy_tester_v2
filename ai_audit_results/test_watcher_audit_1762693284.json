No meaningful quality assessment possible as tests didn't run.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**ZERO COVERAGE** - 0.00% coverage suggests:\n- Tests may be failing during setup/import\n- Test runner configuration issues\n- Critical syntax/runtime errors in test files or code\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe modified files suggest:\n1. **`health_check.py`** - Possible breaking changes in health check endpoints or dependencies\n2. **`backend\\api\\schemas.py`** - Schema validation changes may be incompatible with existing tests\n3. **Import/circular dependency issues** between these modules\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Fix Exit Code -1 First**\n   - Check test runner configuration\n   - Verify all dependencies are installed\n   - Run tests with `-v` flag to see specific failure points\n\n2. **Debug Import Issues**\n   - Test imports of both changed files independently\n   - Check for circular imports between health_check and schemas\n\n3. **Validate Schema Changes**\n   - Ensure schema updates don't break existing API contracts\n   - Test data serialization/deserialization manually\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deployment would be extremely risky:\n- No validation of recent schema changes\n- Health checks potentially broken\n- Complete loss of test coverage visibility\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution before any further development or deployment.",
