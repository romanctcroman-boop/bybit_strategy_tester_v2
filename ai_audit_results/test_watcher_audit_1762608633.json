    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1). No tests ran successfully, indicating either catastrophic test infrastructure issues or severe code defects.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**ZERO COVERAGE** - 0.00% coverage confirms no code was executed. This represents complete test suite failure rather than coverage gaps.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n- **test_perplexity_quick_wins.py** is the only changed file and likely contains syntax errors, import failures, or infinite loops\n- Possible circular imports or dependency conflicts\n- Test infrastructure configuration errors\n- Environment setup failures (missing dependencies, path issues)\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. Run `python -m pytest test_perplexity_quick_wins.py -v` to isolate the failing test\n2. Check for syntax errors: `python -m py_compile test_perplexity_quick_wins.py`\n3. Verify imports and dependencies are available\n4. Add `--tb=short` to get concise error tracebacks\n\n**STRUCTURAL FIXES:**\n1. Implement test isolation - run new tests separately before integration\n2. Add pre-commit hooks to validate test syntax\n3. Create smoke tests to verify test infrastructure\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Complete test suite failure means:\n- No validation of any code functionality\n- Potential undetected production defects\n- Broken CI/CD pipeline blocking deployments\n- All recent changes are untested\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
