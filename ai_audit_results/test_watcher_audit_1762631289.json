This indicates either catastrophic test infrastructure issues or severe code defects preventing test execution.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **Total coverage: 0%** - No code was executed during testing\n- **No coverage data available** - Test framework couldn't collect any metrics\n- **Complete testing gap** - Entire codebase remains untested\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **File `full_ai_audit_deepseek_perplexity_deepseek.py` likely contains:**\n   - Syntax errors preventing import/execution\n   - Missing dependencies or imports\n   - Runtime errors during module loading\n   - Infinite loops or blocking operations\n   - Environment configuration issues\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Debug test execution:**\n   - Run `python -m py_compile full_ai_audit_deepseek_perplexity_deepseek.py` to check syntax\n   - Execute the file directly to identify runtime errors\n   - Check for missing imports or dependencies\n\n2. **Fix foundational issues:**\n   - Add basic unit tests that can execute\n   - Ensure minimal test setup works before complex scenarios\n   - Verify environment and dependencies\n\n3. **Implement safety nets:**\n   - Add try-catch blocks in test setup\n   - Create smoke tests that validate basic functionality\n   - Set up pre-commit hooks to catch syntax errors\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- Production code may be completely broken\n- No validation of functionality exists\n- High probability of undetected bugs\n- Deployment would be extremely risky\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
