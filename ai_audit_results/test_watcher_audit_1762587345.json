This indicates either:\n- Syntax errors in test files or code\n- Missing dependencies/environment setup\n- Test framework configuration issues\n- Fatal errors during test discovery/import\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% coverage** - Tests didn't run successfully, making coverage data meaningless. All code is effectively untested.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe changed file `backend\\api\\deepseek_pool.py` likely contains:\n- Syntax errors preventing import/execution\n- Breaking changes to interfaces or dependencies\n- Missing imports or undefined references\n- Configuration/initialization errors\n\n## Recommendations\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. Run tests with `-v` flag to see specific failure details\n2. Check Python syntax: `python -m py_compile backend/api/deepseek_pool.py`\n3. Verify imports work in isolation\n4. Review recent git changes to `deepseek_pool.py` for obvious errors\n\n**Short-term:**\n- Fix test execution before assessing coverage\n- Add basic smoke tests to verify module can import/initialize\n- Ensure test dependencies are installed and configured\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deploying this code would be extremely dangerous:\n- No validation that code actually works\n- Potential runtime crashes in production\n- Unknown impact on dependent systems\n- Complete lack of quality assurance\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
