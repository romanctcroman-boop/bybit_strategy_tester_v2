The test suite is non-functional.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% coverage** - No code was executed during test run. This is not a coverage gap but a complete system failure.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe modified stress test (`test_parallel_execution.py`) likely contains:\n- Infinite loops or resource exhaustion\n- Memory leaks causing system crashes\n- Race conditions leading to deadlocks\n- Environment dependency failures\n- Import errors or syntax issues\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n\n**Priority 1 - Diagnose Crash:**\n```bash\n# Run with verbose output to identify crash point\npython -m pytest tests/stress/test_parallel_execution.py -v -s\n\n# Check for memory limits or resource constraints\npython -c \"import tests.stress.test_parallel_execution\"\n```\n\n**Priority 2 - Isolate the Issue:**\n- Run stress test in isolation with timeout\n- Add debug logging to identify hang/crash location\n- Verify environment dependencies and resource limits\n\n**Priority 3 - Implement Safeguards:**\n- Add timeout decorators to stress tests\n- Implement resource monitoring during execution\n- Create test environment validation checks\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Complete test suite failure means:\n- No validation of any functionality\n- Potential production issues undetected\n- Development blocked until resolved\n- Critical bugs could be deployed\n\n**Action:** Stop all deployments until test infrastructure is restored. The stress test modification is the primary suspect - revert it immediately to restore testing capability.",
