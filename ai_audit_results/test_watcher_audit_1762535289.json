No meaningful quality assessment possible until basic execution is resolved.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% coverage** - All tests failed before any code execution could be measured. This represents a complete testing blackout.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Dependency/Environment Issues**: Missing imports, broken virtual environment, or incompatible package versions\n2. **Syntax/Runtime Errors**: Likely syntax errors in `safe_async_bridge.py` preventing import/execution\n3. **Test Configuration**: Broken test runner configuration or missing test discovery patterns\n4. **Module Import Failures**: `safe_async_bridge.py` may have import cycles or missing dependencies\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions (Priority 1):**\n- Run `python -m py_compile automation\\safe_async_bridge.py` to check for syntax errors\n- Execute tests with `-v` flag to see specific failure details\n- Verify all imports in `safe_async_bridge.py` are available in test environment\n\n**Short-term (Priority 2):**\n- Add basic smoke test to verify module can be imported\n- Check test runner configuration and dependencies\n- Ensure test discovery includes the correct file patterns\n\n**Long-term (Priority 3):**\n- Implement pre-commit hooks to catch syntax errors\n- Add CI pipeline with dependency installation verification\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Complete testing failure means:\n- No safety net for recent changes to `safe_async_bridge.py`\n- Potential runtime errors in production\n- Undetected regression risks\n- **Immediate resolution required before any deployment**\n\n**Next Step**: Focus entirely on fixing the Exit Code -1 issue before addressing coverage metrics.",
