Exit code -1 indicates a fatal error preventing test execution entirely.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% coverage** - No code was executed during testing. This represents a complete testing failure, not just low coverage.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Fatal import/syntax errors** in `full_ai_audit_deepseek_perplexity_deepseek.py`\n2. **Missing dependencies** or environment configuration issues\n3. **Test runner configuration** problems preventing execution\n4. **File corruption** or incomplete changes in the modified file\n\n## Immediate Action Recommendations\n1. **Fix fatal errors first** - Check for syntax errors, import issues, or missing files\n2. **Run basic syntax check**: `python -m py_compile full_ai_audit_deepseek_perplexity_deepseek.py`\n3. **Verify imports** and dependencies are available in test environment\n4. **Test minimal execution**: Run a simple print statement to confirm file loads\n5. **Check test configuration** - Ensure pytest/unittest can discover and run tests\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Code is completely untested and potentially non-functional. Deployment would be extremely risky.\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution immediately before any further development or analysis. The 0% coverage indicates fundamental issues that must be resolved before assessing actual test quality.",
