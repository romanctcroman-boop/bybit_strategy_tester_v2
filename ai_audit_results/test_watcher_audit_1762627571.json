    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely unhandled exception or environment crash). No tests executed successfully.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% coverage = Complete test infrastructure failure.** This isn't a coverage gap - it's a total system breakdown. No code was even measured.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Critical breaking changes** in modified files likely caused test environment crash\n2. **DeepSeek integration files** (`deepseek_review_mcp_server.py`, `apply_deepseek_critical_fixes.py`) may contain:\n   - Syntax errors preventing import/execution\n   - Infinite loops or resource exhaustion\n   - Missing dependencies or imports\n   - Environment configuration conflicts\n\n## Immediate Action Plan\n1. **Debug test runner failure** - Check for stack traces in test logs\n2. **Isolate the breaking change** - Test each modified file independently\n3. **Validate basic imports** - Ensure both modified files can be imported without errors\n4. **Check for infinite recursion** - Common issue with AI-generated fix scripts\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Production deployment would likely fail catastrophically. Code quality is unverifiable without functioning tests.\n\n## Priority Recommendations\n1. **Fix test execution first** - Address the -1 exit code before any feature work\n2. **Add basic smoke tests** - Simple import tests for both modified files\n3. **Validate DeepSeek integration logic** - Manual review for obvious logical errors\n4. **Restore test infrastructure** before proceeding with any further changes\n\n**Immediate next step:** Examine test runner logs to identify the specific crash cause.",
