    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional:\n- Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely unhandled exception during test setup/import)\n- 0% coverage confirms no tests actually executed\n- Test infrastructure itself appears broken\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**COMPLETE COVERAGE BREAKDOWN:**\n- No files were executed or measured\n- All production code remains completely untested\n- Test reliability cannot be assessed\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Import/Module Resolution Failure** - Likely circular imports or missing dependencies between the 4 modified files\n2. **Architecture Conflict** - Multiple MCP server implementations (`reliability\\`, `mcp-server\\`, simplified version) causing namespace collisions\n3. **Test Configuration Broken** - pytest/setup configuration may reference non-existent modules or paths\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. Run tests with `-v` flag to see which specific import/module fails\n2. Check `__init__.py` files and import statements across all 4 modified files\n3. Consolidate duplicate MCP server implementations to single source\n4. Verify PYTHONPATH and module structure consistency\n\n**FOLLOW-UP:**\n- Add basic smoke test that imports main modules before complex tests\n- Implement CI step to validate test execution before coverage measurement\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- Production code changes are completely untested\n- Multiple similar implementations suggest architectural confusion\n- Deployment would be extremely risky without any validation\n- Team velocity blocked until test infrastructure is restored\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development.",
