No meaningful quality assessment possible until basic test execution is resolved.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - Complete coverage failure suggests:\n- Tests cannot execute at all\n- Possible syntax errors or import failures\n- Test runner configuration issues\n- Critical exceptions during test setup\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe single changed file (`health_check.py`) likely contains:\n- **Syntax errors** preventing module import\n- **Fatal runtime exceptions** during import/execution\n- **Missing dependencies** or broken imports\n- **Circular imports** causing import failures\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Fix Test Execution First**:\n   - Run `python -m py_compile health_check.py` to check for syntax errors\n   - Verify imports work: `python -c \"import health_check\"`\n   - Check for runtime errors during import\n\n2. **Debug the Failure**:\n   - Run tests with verbose output to see exact failure point\n   - Check test runner configuration\n   - Verify all dependencies are installed\n\n3. **Add Basic Smoke Test**:\n   - Create minimal test that imports and instantiates key components\n   - Ensure tests can run before measuring coverage\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Production deployment would be extremely risky:\n- No validation that code changes work\n- Unknown if health checks would function\n- Potential for complete service failure\n- Zero confidence in change quality\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
