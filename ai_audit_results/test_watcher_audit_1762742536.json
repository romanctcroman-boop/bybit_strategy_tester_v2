    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test suite is completely broken:\n- Exit code -1 indicates abnormal termination (segmentation fault, memory error, or fatal Python error)\n- 0% coverage suggests tests aren't even executing properly\n- Likely environment or dependency issues preventing test execution\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**NO COVERAGE DATA AVAILABLE** - Tests aren't running to completion. This is more critical than low coverage.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Environment/Dependency Breakage** - Recent changes to `backend\\core\\mtf_engine.py` or `reliability\\perplexity_client.py` may have introduced:\n   - Circular imports or initialization conflicts\n   - Missing dependencies in test environment\n   - Version compatibility issues\n\n2. **Test Infrastructure Failure** - Changes to `tests\\backend\\conftest.py` may have broken test setup/teardown\n\n3. **Resource Exhaustion** - New stress tests (`test_edge_cases_stress.py`) could be causing memory leaks or resource conflicts\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n\n**HIGH PRIORITY:**\n1. **Isolate the Failure**:\n   ```bash\n   python -m pytest tests/ -v --tb=short --maxfail=1\n   ```\n2. **Check Dependencies**: Verify test environment matches development environment\n3. **Test Minimal Configuration**: Run tests without new stress tests to isolate the issue\n\n**MEDIUM PRIORITY:**\n4. **Fix Test Infrastructure First** before addressing coverage\n5. **Add Basic Sanity Tests** that run before full test suite\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deployment should be blocked:\n- No confidence in code changes due to complete test failure\n- Potential for production crashes if similar environment issues exist\n- Critical functionality (MTF engine, database optimization) untested\n\n**Immediate Action**: Fix test execution before analyzing coverage or test quality further. The 0% coverage is a symptom, not the root problem.",
