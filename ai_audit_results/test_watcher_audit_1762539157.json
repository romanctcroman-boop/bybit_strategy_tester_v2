    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates a fatal error preventing test execution entirely. This represents a complete breakdown in test infrastructure.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% coverage** - No code was executed during testing. This means:\n- All test assertions are untested\n- No integration logic was validated\n- Zero confidence in recent changes\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe two modified test files (`test_e2e_test_watcher.py` and `test_e2e_test_watcher_v2.py`) likely contain:\n- Syntax errors preventing import/execution\n- Missing dependencies or imports\n- Configuration errors in test setup\n- Infinite loops or fatal exceptions\n- Broken test infrastructure hooks\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Debug Test Execution**\n   - Run tests with `-v` flag to see specific failure points\n   - Check for import errors in the two modified test files\n   - Verify test dependencies and environment setup\n\n2. **Fix Critical Issues**\n   - Address syntax/import errors in the e2e watcher tests\n   - Ensure test fixtures and setup methods are functional\n   - Validate test configuration files\n\n3. **Add Safety Nets**\n   - Implement pre-commit hooks to catch syntax errors\n   - Add basic smoke tests that run before full test suite\n   - Set up CI pipeline to fail fast on configuration issues\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- Production deployments are essentially untested\n- Recent changes may have broken core functionality\n- No regression detection capability\n- High probability of undetected bugs in production\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
