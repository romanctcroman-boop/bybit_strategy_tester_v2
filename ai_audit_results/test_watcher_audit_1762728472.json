    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely uncaught exception during test setup/execution).\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% coverage** - No code is being executed during tests. This represents complete test infrastructure failure rather than just low coverage.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **parallel_audit_submission.py changes** likely introduced:\n   - Syntax errors preventing import/execution\n   - Missing dependencies or imports\n   - Runtime errors during module loading\n   - Broken test configuration/setup\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Fix test execution first**:\n   - Run tests with `-v` flag to see specific failure\n   - Check for syntax errors in changed file\n   - Verify imports and dependencies\n   - Examine test configuration files\n\n2. **Debug sequence**:\n   ```bash\n   python -m py_compile parallel_audit_submission.py  # Check syntax\n   python -c \"import parallel_audit_submission\"       # Test import\n   pytest -xvs                                        # See first failure\n   ```\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Code is completely untested. Any deployment would be extremely risky. The -1 exit code suggests fundamental problems that could affect production runtime.\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution immediately before any other development.",
