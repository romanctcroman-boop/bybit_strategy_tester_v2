This represents a complete testing breakdown.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **0% coverage** across all files\n- No tests executed successfully\n- Critical gap: Entire codebase untested\n- Missing: Basic test infrastructure validation\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Test infrastructure failure** - Likely caused by recent file changes\n2. **Import/dependency issues** - New modules may have broken imports\n3. **Configuration problems** - Test runner setup may be corrupted\n4. **Syntax errors** - Recent changes may contain fatal Python errors\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Fix test execution first**:\n   - Check for syntax errors in changed files\n   - Verify imports and dependencies\n   - Run tests with `-v` flag to see specific failures\n\n2. **Restore basic functionality**:\n   - Revert recent changes if possible\n   - Run minimal smoke test to confirm basic execution\n   - Validate test configuration files\n\n3. **Implement safety nets**:\n   - Add pre-commit hooks to catch syntax errors\n   - Set up CI pipeline with basic validation\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Code is completely untested and potentially broken.\n- **Deployment Risk**: Extreme - should not deploy until tests are functional\n- **Regression Risk**: High - no protection against breaking changes\n- **Quality Risk**: Critical - no visibility into code behavior\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution immediately before any further development.",
