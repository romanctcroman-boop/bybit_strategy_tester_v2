This indicates either catastrophic test infrastructure issues or severe code defects preventing test execution.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This represents a complete testing blackout, making all recent changes untested and high-risk.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n- The `reliability\\__init__.py` modification likely contains syntax errors, import issues, or runtime exceptions\n- Possible circular imports or module initialization failures\n- Environment/dependency compatibility issues\n- Test runner configuration problems\n\n## Immediate Action Recommendations\n1. **Debug Test Failure**\n   - Check test runner logs for specific error messages\n   - Verify `reliability\\__init__.py` for syntax errors\n   - Test module import in isolation: `python -c \"import reliability\"`\n\n2. **Restore Basic Testing**\n   - Fix the immediate crash preventing test execution\n   - Add minimal smoke tests for module initialization\n   - Ensure tests can run to completion\n\n3. **Infrastructure Check**\n   - Verify test environment dependencies\n   - Confirm pytest/unittest configuration\n   - Check for missing test files or incorrect paths\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - All changes are completely untested. The codebase is effectively flying blind with:\n- No validation of recent changes\n- Unknown regression impact\n- Potential production-breaking defects\n- Compromised deployment safety\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
