    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1). No tests ran successfully, indicating either:\n- Syntax errors in test files or code\n- Missing dependencies/environment setup\n- Test framework configuration issues\n- Fatal errors during test discovery/import\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This represents a complete testing failure, not just low coverage.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe modified `perplexity_client.py` likely contains:\n- Import errors or circular dependencies\n- Syntax errors preventing module loading\n- Missing required dependencies\n- Runtime errors during module initialization\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. Run `python -m py_compile reliability\\perplexity_client.py` to check for syntax errors\n2. Execute tests with `-v` flag to see specific failure details\n3. Verify all imports and dependencies are available in test environment\n4. Check test configuration and ensure proper test discovery\n\n**Follow-up:**\n5. Add basic smoke tests to verify module can be imported\n6. Implement CI pipeline to catch these issues before merge\n7. Add logging to identify where initialization fails\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - The codebase is currently untestable and potentially broken:\n- Production deployments could fail unexpectedly\n- No validation that recent changes work correctly\n- Regression detection is impossible\n- Critical bugs could go undetected\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
