    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1). No tests ran successfully, indicating fundamental infrastructure or configuration issues rather than test logic problems.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This represents a complete testing blackout, making it impossible to assess actual code quality or functionality.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe single changed file `tests\\backend\\conftest.py` is highly suspicious:\n- **Configuration corruption** - pytest configuration/plugins likely broken\n- **Fixture failures** - Critical test dependencies failing to initialize\n- **Import/syntax errors** - Python cannot load the test configuration\n- **Environment mismatch** - Missing dependencies or incompatible versions\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. **Debug conftest.py** - Check for syntax errors, import issues, or fixture definition problems\n2. **Run pytest with `-v` flag** to see specific failure details\n3. **Verify pytest installation** and dependency versions\n4. **Test isolation** - Temporarily rename/remove conftest.py to isolate the issue\n\n**FOLLOW-UP:**\n5. Add pre-commit hooks to validate test configuration\n6. Implement basic smoke tests for test infrastructure\n7. Set up CI pipeline to catch configuration breaks earlier\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - The entire test suite is non-functional, meaning:\n- No regression detection\n- Undetected breaking changes likely\n- Production deployment carries significant failure risk\n- Code quality cannot be measured or guaranteed\n\n**Priority:** Fix test infrastructure immediately before any further development or deployment.",
