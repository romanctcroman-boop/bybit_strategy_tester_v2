    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1) with 0% coverage, indicating fundamental issues in the test environment or codebase.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **Total failure**: 0% coverage across all files\n- **No data available**: Coverage reporting system failed to collect any metrics\n- **Critical gap**: Unable to assess actual code coverage due to test execution failure\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Safe Async Bridge**: Likely contains breaking changes causing test infrastructure failure\n2. **Memory Leak Tests**: May be incompatible with async bridge modifications\n3. **Environment/Dependencies**: Possible missing dependencies or configuration issues\n4. **Import/Initialization**: Critical failures during module loading or test setup\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. Run tests individually to isolate failing component:\n   ```bash\n   python -m pytest tests/stress/test_memory_leaks.py -v\n   python -m pytest automation/safe_async_bridge.py -v\n   ```\n2. Check for syntax errors and import issues in modified files\n3. Verify all dependencies are properly installed and compatible\n\n**Systematic Fixes:**\n1. Add proper error handling in test setup/teardown\n2. Implement incremental testing strategy\n3. Add logging to diagnose initialization failures\n4. Ensure async bridge properly integrates with test framework\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state prevents any meaningful quality assessment:\n- No confidence in code functionality\n- Potential memory leaks undetected\n- Async safety concerns unverified\n- Deployment would be extremely risky\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
