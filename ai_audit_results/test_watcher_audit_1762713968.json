    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional:\n- Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely unhandled exception)\n- 0% coverage means no tests executed successfully\n- Test infrastructure appears broken\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**COMPLETE COVERAGE BREAKDOWN**:\n- No files have any coverage (0% across all files)\n- Test execution isn't reaching any application code\n- Either tests are failing before execution or infrastructure is misconfigured\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n**HIGH-RISK CHANGES DETECTED**:\n1. `fix_tests_final.py` & `add_mocks_to_all_tests.py` - These bulk modification scripts likely introduced breaking changes\n2. Mock over-aggression - May be mocking essential components needed for test execution\n3. Import/dependency issues - Tests might be failing during import/setup phase\n4. Configuration corruption - Test runner or pytest configuration may be broken\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n**PRIORITY 1 - RESTORE TEST EXECUTION**:\n1. **Rollback** the test modification scripts and verify basic test functionality\n2. **Check test imports** - Ensure all modules can be imported without errors\n3. **Run tests individually** - Start with simplest test to identify root cause\n4. **Verify pytest configuration** - Check `pytest.ini`/`conftest.py` for issues\n\n**PRIORITY 2 - VALIDATE MOCK STRATEGY**:\n- Review mock implementations in `add_mocks_to_all_tests.py`\n- Ensure mocks aren't blocking essential test infrastructure\n- Test with reduced mocking scope\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state prevents:\n- Regression detection\n- Code quality validation\n- Safe deployments\n- Continuous integration\n\n**Immediate action required** - Development is effectively flying blind without test feedback. Address test execution before any further feature development.",
