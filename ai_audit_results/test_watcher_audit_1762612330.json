    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely test harness crash or environment issues). No tests executed successfully.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This represents maximum coverage gap - the entire codebase is untested.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n- `mcp-server/server.py` modifications may contain syntax errors or import failures\n- Possible circular imports or missing dependencies\n- Environment configuration issues (Python path, missing packages)\n- Test runner configuration broken\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Fix Test Execution First**\n   - Check test runner configuration and dependencies\n   - Verify Python environment and imports\n   - Run with `-v` flag to see specific failure points\n\n2. **Address Server.py Changes**\n   - Review recent commits to `mcp-server/server.py` for syntax/import issues\n   - Test the module directly: `python -m py_compile mcp-server/server.py`\n\n3. **Establish Baseline**\n   - Get at least one passing test before measuring coverage\n   - Start with simple smoke tests to verify basic functionality\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Code is completely untested and deployment would be reckless. Any changes to `server.py` could introduce undetected breaking changes.\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development.",
