    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Exit code -1 indicates a fatal error preventing test execution. The entire test suite failed to run, making quality assessment impossible. This is a severe infrastructure issue.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% coverage** confirms no tests executed. All coverage gaps exist since no code was exercised.\n\n## Potential Issues\n1. **Test Environment Failure**: Likely configuration, dependency, or environment setup issue\n2. **Recent Changes Impact**: Modified files suggest integration test changes (`test_sandbox_integration.py`, `mtf_engine.py`) may have broken test infrastructure\n3. **Fixture Problems**: `conftest.py` modifications could have broken test setup\n4. **Import/Dependency Issues**: Changes to core modules may have broken test imports\n\n## Immediate Actions Required\n1. **Fix Test Execution First**:\n   - Check test runner configuration\n   - Verify dependencies and environment setup\n   - Run with `-v` flag to identify failure point\n   - Test individual files to isolate the issue\n\n2. **Priority Investigation Order**:\n   - Start with `tests/backend/conftest.py` (fixture changes often break entire suites)\n   - Check `backend/core/mtf_engine.py` for breaking API changes\n   - Verify `tests/test_sandbox_integration.py` isn't hanging or crashing\n\n3. **Quick Diagnostics**:\n   ```bash\n   python -m pytest tests/backend/conftest.py --collect-only\n   python -m pytest tests/test_mtf_engine.py -v\n   ```\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - No test validation means:\n- All recent changes are untested\n- Potential regressions undetected  \n- Production deployment extremely risky\n- Integration points unverified\n\n**Priority: Fix immediately** - Resume normal development only after tests execute successfully.",
