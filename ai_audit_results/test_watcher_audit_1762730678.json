    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1). No tests ran successfully, indicating either:\n- Syntax errors in test files\n- Import failures\n- Fixture/config setup crashes\n- Environment issues\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% coverage** - All tests failed before any code execution. This is worse than having low coverage since no code was exercised at all.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **`test_configurable_jitter.py`** likely contains fatal errors\n2. **Import/circular dependency issues** between changed files\n3. **Missing dependencies** or broken imports in retry policy changes\n4. **Configuration/setup code** in test files causing crashes\n\n## Recommendations\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. Run tests individually to identify which test file fails first\n2. Check `test_configurable_jitter.py` for syntax errors and import statements\n3. Verify all imports in both changed files resolve correctly\n4. Examine test fixtures and setup/teardown methods\n\n**Technical Investigation:**\n```bash\n# Isolate the failure\npython -m pytest test_configurable_jitter.py -v\npython -m pytest reliability/retry_policy.py -v\n```\n\n**Code Review Focus:**\n- Import statements in both files\n- Class/method definitions in `retry_policy.py`\n- Test class setup and fixtures\n- Any global/module-level code execution\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - The entire test suite is non-functional. This means:\n- No validation of recent changes to retry logic\n- Potential production bugs undetected\n- Broken CI/CD pipeline\n- All subsequent changes are untested\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
