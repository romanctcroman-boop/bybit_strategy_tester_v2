    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely unhandled exception or environment crash). No tests executed successfully.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This represents complete testing failure rather than coverage gaps.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n- **server.py modifications** likely introduced fatal errors preventing test execution\n- Possible causes: Syntax errors, import failures, infinite loops, or environment dependencies\n- Test runner unable to even import/load the module\n\n## Immediate Actions Required\n1. **Fix test execution first** - Run tests with verbose output to identify crash cause\n2. **Check server.py syntax** - Validate Python syntax and imports\n3. **Verify dependencies** - Ensure all required packages are installed\n4. **Add basic smoke test** - Create minimal test that imports server.py successfully\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Code is completely untested and potentially broken. Deployment would be extremely risky.\n\n## Priority Recommendations\n1. Run: `python -m pytest -v --tb=short` to get detailed failure info\n2. Add try/except block in test setup to catch import errors\n3. Create simple integration test that verifies server can start\n4. Fix root cause before addressing coverage metrics\n\n**Next Step**: Identify why tests can't even start executing before optimizing coverage.",
