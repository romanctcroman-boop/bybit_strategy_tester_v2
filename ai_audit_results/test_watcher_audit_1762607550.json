    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1). No meaningful quality assessment possible as tests didn't run to completion. This indicates either catastrophic test infrastructure issues or severe code defects preventing test execution.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% coverage** - All coverage metrics are invalid due to test failure. No reliable coverage data exists for analysis.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe failure likely stems from changes in `mcp-server\\api\\providers\\base.py`:\n- **Syntax errors** - Python interpreter cannot parse the file\n- **Import/circular dependency** issues preventing module loading\n- **Missing dependencies** or broken imports\n- **Critical runtime exceptions** during test setup/import phase\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. **Fix test execution first** - Run `python -m py_compile mcp-server/api/providers/base.py` to check for syntax errors\n2. **Verify imports** - Manually import the module to identify dependency issues\n3. **Check test configuration** - Ensure pytest/runner configuration is valid\n\n**Follow-up:**\n4. Add basic smoke tests that verify module importability\n5. Implement CI checks for syntax validation pre-commit\n6. Add logging to test setup to capture failure points\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Production deployment would likely fail completely. The codebase is currently untestable and potentially broken. No safety net exists for the recent changes to the providers module.\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or analysis.",
