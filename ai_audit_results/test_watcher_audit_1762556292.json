No tests ran successfully, indicating fundamental issues with the test environment, dependencies, or codebase integrity.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% coverage** - All files show 0% coverage because:\n- Tests failed to execute at all\n- No code was actually exercised\n- This represents a complete testing blackout\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe migration file `20251020_merge_heads.py` suggests:\n- **Database schema conflicts** - Merge migrations often cause dependency issues\n- **Migration dependency chain broken** - Missing prerequisite migrations\n- **Environment mismatch** - Database state doesn't match expected schema\n- **Import/circular dependency issues** in migration files\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Fix migration dependencies first**:\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py migrate --fake\n   ```\n2. **Run isolated migration test**:\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py migrate backend --dry-run\n   ```\n3. **Check database state**:\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py showmigrations\n   ```\n4. **Test database connectivity** and ensure test database can be created\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deployment would likely fail with:\n- Database migration failures in production\n- Service startup failures\n- Data integrity risks\n- Complete absence of regression protection\n\n**Priority**: Fix immediately before any further development or deployment.",
