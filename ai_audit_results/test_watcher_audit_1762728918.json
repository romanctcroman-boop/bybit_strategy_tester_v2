    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely unhandled exception in test setup/runner). Zero coverage suggests tests never executed.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **100% coverage gap** - No tests executed successfully\n- Both modified files (`retry_policy.py`, `distributed_rate_limiter.py`) completely untested\n- Test infrastructure itself appears broken\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Breaking changes** in modified files that prevent test execution\n2. **Missing dependencies** or import errors in new reliability modules\n3. **Test configuration corruption** (pytest/coverage setup broken)\n4. **Syntax errors** or runtime exceptions in test code\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions (Next 2 hours):**\n1. Run tests with `-v` flag to see specific failure points\n2. Check test runner logs for stack traces\n3. Verify imports in both changed files work correctly\n4. Test modules in isolation: `python -m pytest reliability/ --tb=short`\n\n**Short-term (Today):**\n1. Fix test infrastructure before addressing coverage\n2. Add basic smoke tests for each modified file\n3. Ensure test dependencies are installed and configured\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deploying these changes would be extremely dangerous:\n- Zero test validation for critical reliability components\n- Unknown if core functionality even loads\n- High probability of production failures\n- Rate limiting and retry logic completely unverified\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
