    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely unhandled exception or environment crash). Zero coverage suggests tests never executed properly.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **Total Coverage: 0%** - No code was executed during testing\n- **Missing**: All security-critical components (key management, crypto)\n- **Root Cause**: Likely test environment setup failure or dependency issues\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Master Key Manager**: Possible initialization failures, missing dependencies, or configuration issues\n2. **Crypto Module**: Potential import errors, missing cryptographic libraries, or environment-specific failures\n3. **Common Issues**: \n   - Missing environment variables/configuration\n   - Broken imports in changed files\n   - Hardware/OS-specific crypto requirements not met\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. Run tests with `-v` flag to see exact failure point\n2. Check test logs for stack traces and dependency errors\n3. Verify all security dependencies are installed (cryptography, pycryptodome, etc.)\n\n**Short-term:**\n1. Add basic smoke tests for module imports\n2. Implement error handling in test setup\n3. Create isolated test environment with proper configuration\n\n**Long-term:**\n1. Add security-specific test fixtures\n2. Implement mocking for hardware/OS dependencies\n3. Add integration tests for crypto operations\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Security modules are untested and potentially broken:\n- Cryptographic operations may fail in production\n- Key management could be compromised\n- Zero confidence in security implementation\n- Immediate attention required before deployment\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution environment immediately, then add security-specific test coverage.",
