    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely unhandled exception or environment crash). Zero coverage suggests tests never executed properly.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **Total Coverage: 0%** - No code was executed during testing\n- **No file-specific coverage data** - Testing infrastructure failed before collection\n- **Critical gap**: Entire codebase untested due to execution failure\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe health check related files (`health_checks.py`, `health_checker.py`) likely introduced:\n- **Fatal import errors** or circular dependencies\n- **Environment configuration issues** (missing dependencies, broken imports)\n- **Syntax errors** or runtime exceptions that crash test runner\n- **Incompatible changes** breaking test infrastructure\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. **Fix test execution** - Run tests with `-v` flag to see specific failure points\n2. **Check imports** in changed files for circular dependencies\n3. **Validate environment** - Ensure all dependencies are installed\n4. **Add try-catch blocks** around health check initialization\n\n**Medium-term:**\n5. Implement basic smoke tests before full test suite\n6. Add integration test for health check endpoints\n7. Set up test environment validation script\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- **Production instability** - If tests can't run, deployments are risky\n- **Regression risk** - No safety net for future changes\n- **Critical path failure** - Health checks are essential for system monitoring\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
