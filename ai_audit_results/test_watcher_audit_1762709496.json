    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1), indicating fundamental issues with the test environment, dependencies, or test code structure. No meaningful quality assessment possible as tests didn't run.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**ZERO COVERAGE** - 0.00% coverage confirms no tests executed successfully. All code paths are untested, including the modified `deepseek_client.py`.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Dependency/Import Issues** - Changes in `deepseek_client.py` likely broke imports or dependencies\n2. **Syntax/Initialization Errors** - Possible syntax errors or initialization failures preventing test execution\n3. **Environment Configuration** - Missing environment variables, API keys, or configuration files\n4. **Breaking Interface Changes** - Modified class/method signatures without updating tests\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n1. **Immediate Action:**\n   - Run tests with `-v` flag to see specific failure details\n   - Check Python syntax: `python -m py_compile reliability/deepseek_client.py`\n   - Verify imports and dependencies are installed\n\n2. **Fix Priority:**\n   - Resolve Exit Code -1 first (environment/import issues)\n   - Add basic smoke tests for `deepseek_client.py`\n   - Implement minimal unit tests covering core functionality\n\n3. **Testing Strategy:**\n   - Start with simple connection/initialization tests\n   - Mock external dependencies (API calls)\n   - Add error handling tests\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deploying these changes would be extremely risky:\n- Zero test coverage means undetected bugs are guaranteed\n- Exit Code -1 suggests fundamental stability issues\n- No validation of the modified client functionality\n- Potential for production outages or data corruption\n\n**Next Steps:** Fix the test execution failure before addressing coverage gaps.",
