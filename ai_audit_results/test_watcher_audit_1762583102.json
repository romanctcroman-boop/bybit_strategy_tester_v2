    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional:\n- Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely unhandled exception or environment crash)\n- Zero test execution suggests fundamental infrastructure or dependency issues\n- No meaningful quality assessment possible until basic test execution is restored\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**COVERAGE: 0%** - Complete coverage failure:\n- No files were actually tested\n- Coverage data is empty, indicating tests never ran\n- This represents a complete testing breakdown\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe modified files suggest:\n1. **`analyze_ide_problems.py`** - Likely contains analysis logic that may have:\n   - Unhandled exceptions crashing the test runner\n   - Missing dependencies or imports\n   - Environment configuration issues\n\n2. **`backend\\api\\deepseek_pool.py`** - API/backend changes may have:\n   - Broken imports or dependencies\n   - Introduced runtime errors that prevent test initialization\n   - Configuration changes affecting test environment\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n\n**HIGH PRIORITY - FIX TEST EXECUTION:**\n1. Run tests with `-v` flag to see which test fails first\n2. Check for unhandled exceptions in test setup/teardown\n3. Verify all dependencies are installed and compatible\n4. Ensure test configuration matches development environment\n\n**MEDIUM PRIORITY:**\n1. Add try/catch blocks around test initialization\n2. Implement basic smoke tests to validate environment\n3. Check for circular imports in changed files\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**SEVERE RISK** - Deployment would be extremely risky:\n- No validation of recent changes to analysis and API components\n- Potential for production crashes or data corruption\n- Complete loss of testing safety net\n\n**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:** Fix test execution before any further development or deployment. Start by running the simplest possible test to identify the root cause of the crash.",
