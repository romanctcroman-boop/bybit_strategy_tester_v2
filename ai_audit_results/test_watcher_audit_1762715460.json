This indicates either:\n- Test framework configuration issues\n- Fatal errors during test discovery/import\n- Environment setup problems\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% coverage** - No tests ran successfully. This is a severe regression from any previous coverage levels.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **`.venv` modification** - Changes in virtual environment packages (psycopg2) suggest dependency conflicts\n2. **`mcp_manager.py`** - Likely contains breaking changes that prevent test execution\n3. **`temp_pg_test.py`** - Possibly contains malformed test code or import errors\n\n## Immediate Actions Required\n1. **Fix test execution first**:\n   - Check test runner configuration\n   - Verify all imports work correctly\n   - Run with `-v` flag to see where tests fail\n\n2. **Isolate the breaking change**:\n   - Revert `mcp_manager.py` changes and test\n   - Check if `temp_pg_test.py` runs independently\n   - Verify psycopg2 compatibility\n\n3. **Add basic smoke test**:\n   ```python\n   def test_imports():\n       import reliability.mcp_manager\n       # Basic functionality check\n   ```\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - No test feedback means undetected production bugs are likely. The codebase is currently untested and potentially unstable.\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution immediately before any further development.",
