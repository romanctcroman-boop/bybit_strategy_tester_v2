Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely uncaught exception during test setup/execution). Zero coverage suggests tests never executed.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **0% coverage across all files** - No code was executed during testing\n- **Complete testing blackout** - Recent changes broke the entire test harness\n- **No regression protection** - All changes in modified files are untested\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Import/circular dependency breaks** in `deepseek_pool_refactored.py` or `task_queue.py`\n2. **Missing dependencies** - Required modules not installed/available\n3. **Configuration breaks** - Environment setup failures\n4. **Syntax errors** - Python cannot parse the modified files\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Fix test execution first**:\n   ```bash\n   python -m pytest --collect-only  # Identify collection errors\n   python -c \"import backend.api.deepseek_pool_refactored\"  # Check importability\n   ```\n\n2. **Isolate the break**:\n   - Temporarily revert recent changes to identify breaking commit\n   - Check for missing imports/new dependencies\n   - Validate Python syntax in modified files\n\n3. **Add basic smoke tests**:\n   - Create minimal test that imports both changed files\n   - Add health check for core functionality\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Production deployment would be extremely dangerous:\n- Zero test coverage means undetected runtime failures are likely\n- Critical path components (API, task queue) are completely untested\n- Potential for silent data corruption or service outages\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution immediately before any further development.",
