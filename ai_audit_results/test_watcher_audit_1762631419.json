    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely unhandled exception or environment crash). Zero coverage suggests tests never executed properly.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **Total Coverage: 0%** - No code was executed during testing\n- **Missing**: All modules, functions, and edge cases\n- **Root Cause**: Test infrastructure failure, not coverage gaps\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Rate Limiter Changes**: Likely introduced breaking changes causing system crash\n2. **Interface Changes**: Modified contracts that broke dependent components\n3. **Possible Issues**:\n   - Import cycles between rate_limiter.py and interfaces.py\n   - Missing dependencies or initialization requirements\n   - Syntax errors or runtime exceptions in new code\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. Run tests with `-v` flag to see specific failure points\n2. Check for syntax errors: `python -m py_compile mcp-server/*.py`\n3. Test modules individually to isolate the crashing component\n4. Add try-catch blocks around test execution to capture exceptions\n\n**STRUCTURAL FIXES:**\n1. Implement basic smoke tests before full test suite\n2. Add integration tests for rate_limiter and interfaces interaction\n3. Set up CI pipeline with fail-fast on syntax/import errors\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- Production deployment would likely fail\n- No validation of rate limiting logic\n- Potential security risks if rate limiting is compromised\n- Business impact: Service instability or security vulnerabilities\n\n**Priority**: Fix test infrastructure immediately before any further development.",
