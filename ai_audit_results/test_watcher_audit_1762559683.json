No tests ran successfully, indicating either:\n- Syntax errors in test files or code\n- Missing dependencies/environment setup\n- Test framework configuration issues\n- Fatal errors during test discovery\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This is a direct result of the test execution failure, not a coverage measurement issue.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe single changed file `ask_deepseek_chat_directly.py` likely contains:\n- Syntax errors preventing import/execution\n- Missing imports or dependencies\n- Runtime errors during module loading\n- Circular imports or initialization issues\n\n## Recommendations\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. **Fix Test Execution First** - Run tests with verbose output to identify the specific failure cause\n2. **Check Syntax** - Validate `ask_deepseek_chat_directly.py` for Python syntax compliance\n3. **Verify Dependencies** - Ensure all required packages are installed and accessible\n4. **Test Isolation** - Run tests for this specific file separately to isolate the issue\n\n**Technical Steps:**\n```bash\npython -m py_compile ask_deepseek_chat_directly.py  # Check syntax\npython -c \"import ask_deepseek_chat_directly\"       # Test import\npytest -v --tb=short                               # Get detailed failure info\n```\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - The codebase is currently untestable:\n- No validation of recent changes\n- Potential runtime errors in production\n- Zero confidence in code functionality\n- Deployment would be extremely risky\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
