Exit code -1 indicates a fatal error during test execution, preventing any tests from running.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0.00% coverage** - No code was executed during testing. This represents a complete testing failure, not just low coverage.\n\n## Potential Issues\n1. **Test Harness Failure**: The test runner itself is crashing before any tests execute\n2. **Import/Dependency Issues**: Likely missing imports or broken dependencies in the test file\n3. **Syntax Errors**: Possible Python syntax errors in `test_request_deduplication.py`\n4. **Configuration Problems**: Test configuration or setup code may be causing crashes\n\n## Immediate Actions Required\n1. **Fix Test Execution First**:\n   - Run `python -m pytest tests/test_request_deduplication.py -v` to see specific error details\n   - Check for syntax errors: `python -m py_compile tests/test_request_deduplication.py`\n   - Verify all imports and dependencies are available\n\n2. **Debug the Test File**:\n   - Comment out all test methods and gradually uncomment to identify the failing code\n   - Check fixture setups and teardowns\n   - Verify test dependencies are installed\n\n3. **Validate Test Environment**:\n   - Ensure pytest and required testing libraries are properly installed\n   - Check Python version compatibility\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - With 0% test coverage and broken test execution:\n- No regression protection for request deduplication logic\n- High probability of undetected production bugs\n- Deployment would be extremely risky\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
