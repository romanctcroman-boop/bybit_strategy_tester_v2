    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely unhandled exception or environment crash). Zero coverage suggests tests never executed properly.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **Total Coverage: 0%** - No code was executed during test run\n- **Critical Gap**: Entire test suite failed to initialize/execute\n- **No meaningful coverage data** available due to execution failure\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **MTF Engine Changes** (`mtf_engine.py`) likely introduced breaking changes\n2. **Database/Query Optimization** tests may have environment dependencies failing\n3. **Perplexity Client** integration could be causing initialization crashes\n4. **Test Configuration** (`conftest.py`) may have broken fixtures or imports\n5. **Protocol/Edge Case** tests might be exposing unhandled exceptions\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Debug Execution Failure**:\n   - Run tests with `-v` flag to see which test fails first\n   - Check for import errors in `conftest.py`\n   - Verify all dependencies are installed\n\n2. **Isolate Breaking Changes**:\n   - Temporarily revert `mtf_engine.py` changes and retest\n   - Run tests file-by-file to identify the failure point\n   - Check `perplexity_client.py` for API/client initialization issues\n\n3. **Fix Test Infrastructure**:\n   - Ensure test database connections are valid\n   - Verify external service dependencies (Perplexity client)\n   - Check for missing environment variables\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deployment would be extremely risky:\n- No validation of core MTF engine changes\n- Database optimizations completely untested\n- Integration points unverified\n- Edge cases and stress scenarios not exercised\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
