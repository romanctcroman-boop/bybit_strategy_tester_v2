No tests ran successfully, indicating either:\n- Syntax errors in test files\n- Import failures or dependency issues\n- Test framework configuration problems\n- Critical exceptions during test setup\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This is a direct result of test execution failure, not a coverage measurement issue.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe changed file `tests\\test_mcp_manager.py` likely contains:\n- Syntax errors (missing imports, invalid Python)\n- Broken test fixtures or setup methods\n- Import cycles or module resolution issues\n- Environment/dependency mismatches\n\n## Recommendations\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. **Fix test execution first** - Run tests with verbose output to identify the specific failure\n2. **Check test file syntax** - Validate `test_mcp_manager.py` for basic Python syntax\n3. **Verify imports** - Ensure all required modules and dependencies are available\n4. **Run individual test file** - Isolate the problem by running only the changed test file\n\n**Follow-up:**\n- Once tests execute, establish baseline coverage\n- Add missing test cases for MCP manager functionality\n- Implement continuous integration to catch similar issues earlier\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - No test validation is occurring. Any bugs in MCP manager functionality are undetected. Deployment in this state could lead to:\n- Runtime failures in production\n- Regression issues going unnoticed\n- Potential data loss or system instability\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
