Zero coverage confirms no tests executed successfully.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **Total Coverage: 0%** - No code was executed during testing\n- **Critical Gap**: Entire codebase untested, including security components\n- **Missing**: Unit, integration, and security testing completely absent\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **JWT Manager Changes** (`jwt_manager.py`) - High risk security implications\n2. **AI Audit Module** (`full_ai_audit...py`) - Complex logic changes may have introduced breaking changes\n3. **Dependency Conflicts** - Likely version mismatches or missing imports\n4. **Environment Configuration** - Test environment may be misconfigured or broken\n\n## Immediate Action Recommendations\n1. **Debug Test Infrastructure**\n   - Check test runner configuration and dependencies\n   - Verify Python environment and package versions\n   - Examine test logs for stack traces\n\n2. **Priority Security Testing**\n   - Isolate and test JWT manager independently\n   - Validate token generation/verification logic\n   - Test edge cases and security boundaries\n\n3. **Incremental Test Restoration**\n   - Start with simple unit tests for helper functions\n   - Add integration tests for AI audit module\n   - Implement security test suite for JWT operations\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- Security vulnerabilities likely undetected\n- Production deployment would be extremely risky\n- AI audit functionality potentially compromised\n- Zero confidence in system reliability\n\n**Immediate Priority**: Fix test infrastructure before any further development or deployment.",
