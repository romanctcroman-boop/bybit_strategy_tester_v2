    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test suite is completely broken:\n- Exit code -1 indicates abnormal termination (likely unhandled exception)\n- 0% coverage suggests tests aren't executing properly\n- Recent changes to core engine and multiple test files likely introduced breaking changes\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**COMPLETE COVERAGE FAILURE**:\n- No files show any coverage data\n- Entire codebase is untested in this execution\n- This indicates either test infrastructure failure or catastrophic code errors\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **MTF Engine Changes** (`backend/core/mtf_engine.py`) likely broke test infrastructure\n2. **Multiple test file modifications** suggest widespread refactoring gone wrong\n3. **Database query optimization tests** may have introduced dependency issues\n4. **Sandbox integration** changes could be causing environment failures\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Fix Test Execution First**:\n   - Run tests individually to identify which file causes the crash\n   - Check for uncaught exceptions in test setup/teardown\n   - Verify test dependencies and environment configuration\n\n2. **Investigate Core Changes**:\n   - Review `mtf_engine.py` modifications for breaking API changes\n   - Check if recent changes broke test fixtures or mocking\n\n3. **Restore Basic Functionality**:\n   - Get at least one test passing before addressing coverage\n   - Focus on unit tests before integration tests\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- No reliable testing feedback loop\n- Potential production-breaking changes\n- Undetected regressions across entire system\n- Development is effectively flying blind\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution immediately before any further development. The broken test suite represents the highest priority issue in the codebase.",
