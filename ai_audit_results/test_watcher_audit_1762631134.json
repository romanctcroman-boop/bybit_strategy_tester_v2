    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1). No meaningful quality assessment possible as tests didn't run to completion. This indicates fundamental issues with the test infrastructure or environment.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0.00% COVERAGE** - No code coverage data collected. This is a direct result of test execution failure, not a coverage measurement issue.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **health_check.py changes likely broke test execution**\n   - Syntax errors preventing import/execution\n   - Missing dependencies or imports\n   - Infinite loops or fatal runtime errors\n   - Environment configuration conflicts\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. **Fix test execution first** - Run tests locally to identify the specific failure\n2. **Check health_check.py for syntax/runtime errors**\n3. **Verify test environment setup and dependencies**\n4. **Run minimal smoke test to confirm basic functionality**\n\n**FOLLOW-UP:**\n5. Once tests execute, establish baseline coverage\n6. Add health_check.py specific tests targeting core functionality\n7. Implement CI pipeline checks to catch execution failures earlier\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- Production code may be broken\n- No validation of health_check.py functionality\n- Complete loss of test feedback loop\n- Potential deployment of non-functional code\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
