No tests ran successfully, indicating either:\n- Syntax errors in test files or code\n- Missing dependencies or environment setup issues\n- Test framework configuration problems\n- Fatal errors during test discovery/import\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This is a direct result of test execution failure, not an actual coverage measurement.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe modified file `analysis_tools.py` likely contains:\n- Syntax errors preventing import/execution\n- Missing imports or dependencies\n- Breaking changes to function signatures or class definitions\n- Circular imports or module loading issues\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. **Fix test execution first** - Run tests with verbose output to identify the specific failure point\n2. **Check syntax** - Validate `analysis_tools.py` for Python syntax compliance\n3. **Verify imports** - Ensure all required dependencies are installed and accessible\n4. **Test isolation** - Run tests for the modified file individually to isolate the issue\n\n**Follow-up:**\n5. Once tests execute, establish baseline coverage for the modified file\n6. Add specific tests for new/changed functionality in `analysis_tools.py`\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deploying this code would be extremely risky because:\n- No functionality has been validated\n- Regression testing is completely absent\n- The nature and impact of changes are unknown\n- Could break dependent systems or features\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
