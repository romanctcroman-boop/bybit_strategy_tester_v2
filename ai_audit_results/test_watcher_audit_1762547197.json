No tests ran successfully, indicating either:\n- Syntax errors in test files or application code\n- Missing dependencies or environment configuration issues\n- Test framework configuration problems\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This is a severe indicator that the test suite is non-functional.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n- `backend\\api\\app.py` modifications likely introduced breaking changes\n- Possible syntax errors, import issues, or runtime exceptions\n- Environment/dependency mismatches preventing test execution\n\n## Recommendations\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. **Fix test execution first** - Run tests with verbose output to identify the root cause\n2. **Check application startup** - Verify `app.py` can run independently\n3. **Validate dependencies** - Ensure all required packages are installed and compatible\n\n**Technical Steps:**\n```bash\npython -m pytest -v  # Identify specific test failures\npython backend/api/app.py  # Check if application runs\npip freeze | grep -E \"(pytest|coverage)\"  # Verify test dependencies\n```\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deployment would be extremely risky:\n- No validation of recent changes in `app.py`\n- Complete lack of test coverage\n- Unknown stability of the codebase\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
