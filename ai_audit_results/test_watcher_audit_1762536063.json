    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test suite failed to execute (Exit Code -1). No meaningful test assessment possible as tests didn't run to completion. This indicates fundamental issues with test infrastructure or environment.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0.00% coverage** - No code was executed during testing. This represents a complete testing failure, not just low coverage.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **app.py modifications likely broke test execution** - Changes may have introduced:\n   - Syntax errors preventing import/execution\n   - Missing dependencies or imports\n   - Environment configuration issues\n   - Infinite loops or crashes during module load\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. Run `python -m py_compile backend/api/app.py` to check for syntax errors\n2. Execute tests with `-v` flag to see where they fail\n3. Check test runner configuration and dependencies\n\n**Short-term:**\n1. Add basic smoke test to verify app can start\n2. Implement CI pipeline that fails fast on syntax/import issues\n3. Add logging to identify where test execution fails\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deploying these changes would be extremely dangerous:\n- No validation that code works\n- Potential runtime crashes in production\n- Possible security issues undetected\n- Regression risk: 100% (unknown impact)\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
