No tests ran successfully, indicating either:\n- Syntax errors in test files or code\n- Missing dependencies or environment issues\n- Test framework configuration problems\n- Fatal errors during test setup\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This is a direct result of test execution failure, not a coverage measurement issue.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe modified file `analysis_tools.py` likely contains:\n- Syntax errors preventing import/execution\n- Breaking changes to function signatures or interfaces\n- Missing imports or dependencies\n- Runtime errors that crash during module loading\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Fix Test Execution First**\n   - Check Python syntax in `analysis_tools.py`\n   - Verify all imports are available\n   - Run tests with `-v` flag to see specific failure points\n   - Check test configuration and dependencies\n\n2. **Debugging Steps**\n   ```bash\n   python -m py_compile mcp-server/tools/analysis/analysis_tools.py\n   python -c \"from mcp-server.tools.analysis import analysis_tools\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Restore Basic Testing**\n   - Get at least one test passing before addressing coverage\n   - Add simple smoke tests for core functionality\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Code is completely untested and potentially broken. Deployment would be extremely risky. The -1 exit code suggests fundamental issues that need immediate attention before any meaningful quality assessment can occur.\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution failures before analyzing coverage or test quality further.",
