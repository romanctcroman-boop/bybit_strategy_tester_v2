This indicates either catastrophic test infrastructure issues or severe code defects preventing any tests from running.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **Total coverage: 0.00%** - No code was executed during testing\n- **No coverage data available** - Test framework likely crashed before collecting metrics\n- **Critical gap**: Unable to assess actual code coverage due to test failure\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Fatal runtime error** in `full_ai_audit_deepseek_perplexity_deepseek.py`\n2. **Import/dependency failures** - Missing modules or version conflicts\n3. **Syntax errors** - Recent changes may have introduced invalid Python syntax\n4. **Environment configuration** - Test environment may lack required dependencies\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. **Debug test execution** - Run tests with verbose output to identify the crash point\n2. **Check syntax** - Validate `full_ai_audit_deepseek_perplexity_deepseek.py` for basic Python syntax\n3. **Verify dependencies** - Ensure all imports and requirements are available in test environment\n4. **Run minimal test** - Create a simple smoke test to verify basic functionality\n\n**Follow-up:**\n5. **Add error handling** - Implement try-catch blocks to capture and log initialization errors\n6. **Isolate changes** - Test the modified file in isolation to pinpoint the issue\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- Production deployment would likely fail\n- No validation of recent code changes\n- Potential for runtime crashes in production\n- Complete lack of quality assurance\n\n**Priority**: Resolve test execution failure before any further development or deployment.",
