    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - The test suite is completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates a fatal error before tests could execute, likely due to:\n- Syntax errors in test files\n- Missing dependencies or imports\n- Configuration issues in test runner\n- Environment setup failures\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% coverage** confirms no tests ran successfully. This represents maximum risk - we have no visibility into code functionality or regression protection.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe changed file `test_code_agent_multikey.py` is likely the culprit:\n- Contains fatal syntax errors (Python cannot parse)\n- Missing critical imports or dependencies\n- May have broken test configuration/hooks\n- Could be incompatible with current test environment\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. Fix syntax errors in `test_code_agent_multikey.py`\n2. Verify all imports and dependencies are available\n3. Run tests with `-v` flag to see specific failure details\n4. Check test configuration files for recent changes\n\n**Short-term:**\n- Add pre-commit hooks to validate syntax\n- Implement basic smoke tests that run before full suite\n- Set up CI to fail fast on syntax errors\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state:\n- No regression protection\n- Potential production-breaking changes could go undetected\n- Development is effectively flying blind\n- Urgent fix required before any further changes\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately - this blocks all meaningful quality assessment.",
