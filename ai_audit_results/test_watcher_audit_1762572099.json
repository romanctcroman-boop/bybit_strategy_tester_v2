The test infrastructure itself is broken, making quality assessment impossible.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**COMPLETE COVERAGE FAILURE** - No code was executed during testing. All coverage metrics are at 0%, indicating the test runner cannot even start.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n- **conftest.py modification likely broke test infrastructure** - This file contains pytest configuration and fixtures\n- **Possible causes**: Syntax errors, import failures, fixture conflicts, or configuration changes in conftest.py\n- **Test environment may be misconfigured** or dependencies missing\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n1. **IMMEDIATE**: Fix conftest.py - check for syntax errors, import issues, or configuration problems\n2. **Run pytest with `-v` flag** to see specific error messages and stack traces\n3. **Validate test environment** - ensure all dependencies are installed and compatible\n4. **Test conftest.py in isolation** using `pytest --collect-only` to verify fixture loading\n5. **Roll back conftest.py changes** if recent modifications caused the failure\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Entire test suite is non-functional:\n- No regression detection\n- No quality gates active\n- High probability of undetected production issues\n- Deployment blocking is ineffective\n\n**Priority: CRITICAL** - Fix test infrastructure immediately before any further development or deployment.",
