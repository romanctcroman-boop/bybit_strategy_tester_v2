    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely unhandled exception or environment crash). No tests executed successfully.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This represents complete test infrastructure failure rather than coverage gaps.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n- **app.py modifications** likely introduced fatal errors preventing test execution\n- Possible causes:\n  - Syntax errors in app.py\n  - Missing imports/dependencies\n  - Environment configuration issues\n  - Infinite loops or blocking operations\n  - Critical exceptions during module import\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Fix Test Execution First**\n   - Check app.py for syntax errors\n   - Verify all imports and dependencies are available\n   - Run with debug flags to identify crash point\n\n2. **Restore Basic Functionality**\n   - Revert app.py changes if recent\n   - Add try-catch blocks around critical sections\n   - Ensure tests can at least start executing\n\n3. **Add Basic Smoke Test**\n   - Create minimal test that verifies application can start\n   - Test imports and basic initialization\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Unable to validate any functionality. Production deployment would be extremely risky without passing tests. Current state provides zero quality assurance.\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development.",
