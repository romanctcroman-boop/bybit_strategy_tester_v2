    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1) with zero coverage. This indicates either a catastrophic test infrastructure issue or severe code defects preventing test execution.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **Total Coverage: 0.00%** - No code was executed during testing\n- **No coverage data available** - Test framework failed before collecting metrics\n- **Critical gap**: Unable to assess actual code coverage due to execution failure\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe modified file `tests/integration/api_keys_loader.py` likely contains:\n- Syntax errors preventing import/execution\n- Missing dependencies or imports\n- Configuration errors in test setup\n- Infinite loops or fatal exceptions during test initialization\n- Environment setup failures\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. **Fix test execution first** - Run tests locally to identify the specific failure\n2. **Check syntax and imports** in `api_keys_loader.py`\n3. **Verify test dependencies** and environment configuration\n4. **Add test debugging** with detailed error logging\n\n**Structural Improvements:**\n1. Implement pre-commit hooks to catch syntax errors\n2. Add smoke tests that run before full test suite\n3. Set up test environment validation checks\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- No reliable testing is occurring\n- Potential for undetected production defects\n- Broken CI/CD pipeline\n- All recent changes are effectively untested\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution immediately before any further development.",
