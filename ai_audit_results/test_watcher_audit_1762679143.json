No tests ran successfully, indicating fundamental issues with the test infrastructure or environment setup.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**ZERO COVERAGE** - 0.00% coverage across all files. No code was executed during testing, making coverage metrics meaningless until test execution is fixed.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe failure likely stems from changes in `tests\\backend\\conftest.py`:\n- **Fixture failures** - Pytest configuration/setup fixtures may be broken\n- **Import errors** - Missing dependencies or incorrect imports in conftest\n- **Configuration errors** - Invalid pytest configuration or hooks\n- **Environment issues** - Missing environment variables or test dependencies\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. **Debug conftest.py** - Check for syntax errors, import issues, or fixture failures\n2. **Run pytest with `-v` flag** to see specific error messages\n3. **Test isolation** - Temporarily remove/comment out conftest.py changes to identify the breaking change\n4. **Check dependencies** - Verify all test requirements are installed\n\n**FOLLOW-UP:**\n- Add pre-commit hooks to validate pytest configuration\n- Implement CI pipeline that fails fast on configuration errors\n- Create smoke tests for test infrastructure\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - The entire test suite is non-functional, meaning:\n- No regression detection\n- Potential undetected production bugs\n- Deployment blocking until resolved\n- All code changes are effectively untested\n\n**Priority: Fix immediately** - This blocks all meaningful quality assurance and deployment processes.",
