No tests actually ran successfully.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **0.00% coverage** - No code was executed during testing\n- Complete coverage gap across entire codebase\n- Test infrastructure itself may be broken\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Test file `test_deepseek_client.py` likely contains syntax errors** or import failures\n2. **Dependencies missing** - Required packages may not be installed\n3. **Configuration issues** - Test runner setup may be broken\n4. **Fixtures/SetUp failures** - Test initialization code crashing\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. Run tests with `-v` flag to see which specific test fails first\n2. Check Python syntax: `python -m py_compile tests/test_deepseek_client.py`\n3. Verify imports and dependencies in test file\n4. Run minimal test case to isolate the failure point\n\n**FOLLOW-UP:**\n- Fix the crashing test before addressing coverage\n- Add test discovery validation to CI pipeline\n- Implement basic smoke test to prevent complete test suite failure\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - No test validation is occurring, meaning:\n- Code changes cannot be safely deployed\n- Regressions undetectable\n- Production stability compromised\n- Entire test suite is non-functional\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development.",
