This represents a complete breakdown in testing infrastructure.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code is being tested. The testing pipeline is either:\n- Failing before any tests execute\n- Tests are not properly configured/imported\n- Test discovery is broken\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe modified file `tests/test_circuit_breaker.py` likely contains:\n- Syntax errors preventing test execution\n- Import errors breaking the test module\n- Configuration issues in test setup/teardown\n- Missing dependencies for the circuit breaker implementation\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Fix Test Execution First** - Address the exit code -1 before anything else\n2. **Check test_circuit_breaker.py** for:\n   - Python syntax validity\n   - Correct imports and dependencies\n   - Proper test class/method structure\n3. **Verify test discovery** - Ensure pytest/unittest can find and run tests\n4. **Run with verbose output** to see exact failure point\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deploying without functional tests exposes the system to:\n- Undetected runtime errors in circuit breaker logic\n- Potential service outages from broken fault tolerance\n- Regression risks across the entire codebase\n- Complete loss of CI/CD quality gates\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
