No tests ran successfully, indicating either:\n- Syntax errors in test files or code\n- Missing dependencies/environment setup\n- Test framework configuration issues\n- Fatal errors during test discovery/import\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This is a direct result of test execution failure, not a coverage measurement issue.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe modified `reliability\\deepseek_client.py` likely contains:\n- **Syntax errors** preventing module import\n- **Missing imports** or dependencies\n- **Circular imports** causing import failures\n- **Configuration errors** in the module\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n1. **Immediate Actions:**\n   - Run `python -m py_compile reliability\\deepseek_client.py` to check for syntax errors\n   - Verify all imports in the changed file are available\n   - Check test runner configuration and dependencies\n\n2. **Debugging Steps:**\n   - Run tests with `-v` flag to see specific failure points\n   - Test import of the changed module in isolation\n   - Check for missing `__init__.py` files in package structure\n\n3. **Process Improvements:**\n   - Add pre-commit hooks to catch syntax errors\n   - Implement basic smoke tests before full test suite\n   - Ensure CI environment matches development setup\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - The codebase is currently untestable:\n- No validation of recent changes\n- Potential runtime errors in production\n- Broken functionality cannot be detected\n- All existing functionality is unverified\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
