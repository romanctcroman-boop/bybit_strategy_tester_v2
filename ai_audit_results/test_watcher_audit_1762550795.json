This indicates fundamental issues with test infrastructure or environment.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - Complete coverage failure. No code was executed during testing, suggesting:\n- Test runner configuration issues\n- Missing dependencies or environment setup\n- Test discovery failures\n- Fatal errors before coverage measurement\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe modification to `backend\\api\\app.py` likely introduced:\n- Syntax errors preventing import/execution\n- Missing imports or dependency changes\n- Configuration breaking changes\n- Runtime errors during module loading\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n1. **Immediate Actions:**\n   - Check test runner logs for specific error details\n   - Verify `app.py` syntax and imports\n   - Ensure all dependencies are installed\n   - Test import of `app.py` in isolation\n\n2. **Infrastructure Fixes:**\n   - Add pre-commit hooks to catch syntax errors\n   - Implement basic smoke tests before full test suite\n   - Set up test environment validation\n\n3. **Process Improvements:**\n   - Require all changes to pass basic import tests\n   - Add CI pipeline status checks\n   - Monitor test execution stability\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deploying this code would be extremely risky due to:\n- Unknown functionality status\n- Potential runtime failures in production\n- Complete lack of test validation\n- Possible breaking changes to core API\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
