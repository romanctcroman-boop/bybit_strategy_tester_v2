Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely unhandled exception or environment crash).\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% coverage** - No code is being executed during test runs. This represents complete testing infrastructure failure.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n- Server.py modifications likely introduced fatal errors preventing test execution\n- Possible causes: syntax errors, import failures, infinite loops, or environment dependency breaks\n- Test runner itself may be crashing before any coverage collection\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Debug Test Infrastructure First**\n   - Run tests with `-v` flag to see where they fail\n   - Check for syntax errors: `python -m py_compile mcp-server/server.py`\n   - Verify imports and dependencies\n\n2. **Isolate the Failure**\n   - Comment out recent changes in server.py to identify breaking modifications\n   - Run minimal smoke test to verify basic functionality\n\n3. **Restore Basic Testing**\n   - Create a simple passing test to verify test framework works\n   - Gradually reintroduce functionality while monitoring test execution\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Codebase is completely untested and potentially unstable. Deployment would be extremely risky without resolving test infrastructure.\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution before any further development or deployment.",
