No meaningful quality assessment possible until tests can run successfully.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**ZERO COVERAGE** - 0.00% coverage across all files suggests:\n- Tests are not executing at all\n- Possible import/initialization failures\n- Test discovery/config issues\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe two modified files (`add_logging_wrapper.py`, `add_logging_to_tools.py`) likely contain:\n- Syntax errors preventing import/execution\n- Circular dependencies\n- Missing imports or dependencies\n- Runtime errors during module initialization\n- Logging configuration conflicts\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. **Fix Exit Code -1 First** - Run tests with verbose output to identify the root cause\n2. **Check Syntax** - Validate both modified files for Python syntax errors\n3. **Test Isolation** - Run tests on each modified file individually to isolate the failing component\n4. **Review Logging Changes** - Logging modifications often cause silent failures during import\n\n**Secondary Actions:**\n5. Add basic smoke tests for logging functionality\n6. Implement test logging to capture initialization failures\n7. Verify logging dependencies are properly installed\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- Production deployment would be extremely risky\n- No validation of recent logging changes\n- Potential silent failures in production\n- Complete loss of test feedback loop\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
