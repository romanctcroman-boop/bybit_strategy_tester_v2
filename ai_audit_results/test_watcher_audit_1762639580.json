    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely unhandled exception or system error). No tests executed successfully.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This represents complete test infrastructure failure rather than coverage gaps.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Server.py modifications** likely introduced:\n   - Syntax errors preventing import/execution\n   - Missing dependencies or imports\n   - Runtime exceptions during test setup\n   - Environment configuration issues\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. Run tests with `-v` flag to see specific failure details\n2. Check server.py for syntax errors: `python -m py_compile mcp-server/server.py`\n3. Verify imports and dependencies in server.py\n4. Run minimal test to isolate failure: `python -m pytest mcp-server/ --tb=short`\n\n**FOLLOW-UP:**\n- Add basic smoke test to prevent complete test suite collapse\n- Implement test environment validation\n- Add error handling in test setup/teardown\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Codebase is completely untested. Any deployment carries significant risk of runtime failures. Recent changes to server.py are unverified and likely contain critical bugs.\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
