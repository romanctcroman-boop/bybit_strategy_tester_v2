    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1) with 0% coverage. This indicates either:\n- Syntax/runtime errors preventing test execution\n- Test framework configuration issues\n- Critical failures in test setup/teardown\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**ZERO COVERAGE** - No code was executed during test run. This is a severe regression requiring immediate attention.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **fix_test_monitoring.py** - Likely introduced breaking changes\n2. **tests/test_deepseek_client.py** - May contain syntax errors or incompatible test structure\n3. Possible circular imports or missing dependencies in test configuration\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Run tests individually** to isolate the failure:\n   ```bash\n   python -m pytest tests/test_deepseek_client.py -v\n   ```\n2. **Check for syntax errors** in both changed files\n3. **Verify test configuration** (pytest.ini, conftest.py, imports)\n4. **Examine test fixtures** and setup/teardown logic\n5. **Review recent dependency changes** that might affect test execution\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - No test validation is occurring, meaning:\n- All code changes are effectively untested\n- Production defects likely to pass undetected\n- Critical functionality may be broken\n- Requires immediate resolution before any deployments\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution before addressing coverage gaps.",
