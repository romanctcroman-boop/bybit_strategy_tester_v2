The test suite is non-functional and provides zero quality assurance.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% coverage** - No code is being tested. The crash prevents any meaningful coverage measurement, making it impossible to assess actual gaps.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n- **test_crash.py** is likely causing the entire test suite to fail\n- Possible causes: infinite loop, segmentation fault, import errors, or environment configuration issues\n- Test infrastructure may be improperly configured\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n1. **Immediate**: Isolate and debug test_crash.py - run it separately to identify the crash cause\n2. **Fix root cause**: Address the specific failure (memory issues, dependency problems, etc.)\n3. **Add test isolation**: Ensure tests can run independently without crashing the entire suite\n4. **Implement basic smoke tests**: Add simple validation tests before comprehensive testing\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - No functional testing is occurring, meaning:\n- All code changes are untested\n- Regression detection is impossible\n- Production deployments carry significant failure risk\n- Immediate attention required to restore testing capability\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution before any further development or deployment.",
