    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution is completely broken. Exit code -1 indicates a fatal error before any tests could run. This represents a complete testing infrastructure failure.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% coverage** - No code was executed during testing. This is not a coverage gap but a complete testing system failure.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe single changed file `tests\\backend\\conftest.py` is almost certainly the root cause. Likely issues:\n- Syntax errors in pytest configuration/fixtures\n- Import failures in test setup\n- Fixture dependency conflicts\n- Environment configuration errors\n- Plugin compatibility issues\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. **Debug conftest.py** - Check for syntax errors, missing imports, or circular dependencies\n2. **Run pytest with `-v` flag** to see specific error messages\n3. **Test isolation** - Temporarily rename/remove conftest.py to verify it's the culprit\n4. **Check pytest version compatibility** with conftest.py changes\n\n**Process Improvements:**\n- Add pre-commit hooks to validate pytest configuration\n- Implement staged testing (unit → integration → system)\n- Set up automated test environment validation\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - No testing validation means:\n- Undetected breaking changes in production code\n- Potential deployment of broken functionality\n- Regression risks across entire codebase\n- Compliance/quality standard violations\n\n**Priority:** Fix immediately before any further development or deployment.",
