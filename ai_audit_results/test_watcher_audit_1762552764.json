    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1). No meaningful test quality can be assessed since tests didn't run to completion. This indicates either catastrophic test infrastructure issues or severe code defects preventing test execution.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0.00% coverage** - No code was executed during testing. This is a direct result of the test failure, not an actual measurement of test coverage.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe `lru_ttl_cache.py` modification likely contains:\n- **Syntax errors** preventing module import\n- **Import/circular dependency issues** \n- **Runtime exceptions** during module initialization\n- **Missing dependencies** causing import failures\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. **Fix test execution first** - Run tests with `-v` flag to see specific failure points\n2. **Check import chain** - Verify `lru_ttl_cache.py` imports correctly in isolation\n3. **Validate syntax** - Run `python -m py_compile backend/api/lru_ttl_cache.py`\n\n**Follow-up:**\n4. Add basic smoke test to verify module can be imported\n5. Implement minimal unit test for cache functionality\n6. Ensure test dependencies are properly installed\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Code is completely untested and potentially broken. Deploying this change would be extremely risky as:\n- No functionality validation exists\n- Potential runtime failures in production\n- Could break dependent components\n- Zero confidence in code correctness\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
