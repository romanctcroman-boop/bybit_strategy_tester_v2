This indicates either:\n- Syntax errors in test or production code\n- Import failures or dependency issues\n- Test framework configuration problems\n- Fatal runtime errors during test setup\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**COMPLETE COVERAGE FAILURE** - 0% coverage across all files suggests:\n- Tests aren't executing at all\n- No code paths are being exercised\n- Likely failing before any test logic runs\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nFocus on the modified files:\n1. **`tests/monitoring/test_metrics_export.py`** - Likely contains syntax errors, import issues, or test configuration problems\n2. **`automation/metrics/collectors/system_collector.py`** - Changes may have introduced breaking changes that prevent test execution\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Debug Exit Code -1**\n   - Check test runner logs for specific error messages\n   - Run `pytest -v tests/monitoring/test_metrics_export.py` to isolate the failing test\n   - Verify imports in both changed files\n\n2. **Validate Syntax & Dependencies**\n   - Run `python -m py_compile` on both changed files\n   - Check for missing imports or circular dependencies\n   - Verify all required packages are installed\n\n3. **Test Isolation**\n   - Temporarily revert recent changes to identify the breaking modification\n   - Run tests on each file individually to pinpoint the failure source\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Production code cannot be validated:\n- Undetected bugs may be deployed\n- No quality gates are functioning\n- System reliability is compromised\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
