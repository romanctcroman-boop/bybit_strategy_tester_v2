    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1). No meaningful testing occurred. This indicates either catastrophic test infrastructure issues or severe code defects preventing test execution.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This is not a coverage gap but a complete testing failure.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **health_check.py likely contains fatal errors** preventing import/execution\n2. Possible syntax errors, import cycles, or runtime exceptions during module loading\n3. Test runner configuration may be broken\n4. Dependencies might be missing or incompatible\n\n## Recommendations\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. **Fix test execution first** - Run tests with verbose output to identify the root cause\n2. **Check health_check.py for basic syntax** - `python -m py_compile health_check.py`\n3. **Verify imports and dependencies** - Ensure all required packages are installed\n4. **Run minimal test** - Create a simple test that imports health_check.py to isolate the issue\n\n**FOLLOW-UP:**\n5. Once tests execute, establish baseline coverage and implement meaningful tests\n6. Add health checks for test infrastructure itself\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Code is completely untested and potentially non-functional. Deployment would be extremely risky. The -1 exit code suggests system-level failures that need immediate attention before any feature development continues.\n\n**Priority: Fix test execution before addressing coverage or test quality.**",
