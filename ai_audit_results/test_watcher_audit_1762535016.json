    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1), indicating fundamental issues with either the test suite or codebase. No meaningful quality assessment possible until basic test execution is resolved.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% COVERAGE** - Complete coverage failure suggests:\n- Tests cannot execute at all\n- Possible import errors or runtime crashes\n- Test configuration issues\n- Missing dependencies or environment setup\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe failure coincides with changes to `health_check.py`, likely culprits:\n- Syntax errors in the modified file\n- Breaking changes to imports/API\n- Missing required dependencies\n- Infinite loops or crashes during module import\n- Circular imports introduced\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. Run `python -m py_compile health_check.py` to check for syntax errors\n2. Execute `python -c \"import health_check\"` to test basic import functionality\n3. Check test runner configuration and dependencies\n4. Review recent changes to `health_check.py` for obvious bugs\n\n**Follow-up:**\n- Add basic smoke tests before comprehensive test suites\n- Implement CI checks for syntax and import validation\n- Consider test isolation to prevent single file changes from breaking entire suite\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- No reliable testing feedback loop\n- Potential undiscovered regressions\n- Deployment risks significantly increased\n- Code quality cannot be measured or assured\n\n**Priority:** Resolve test execution failure immediately before any further development or deployment.",
