Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely segmentation fault, memory error, or environment crash). Zero coverage confirms no tests executed successfully.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **Total Coverage: 0.00%** - No code was executed during testing\n- **No file-specific coverage data** - Testing infrastructure failed before collecting metrics\n- **Complete testing blackout** - Unable to assess any functional coverage\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Database migration conflicts** - Multiple migration files (`merge_all_heads.py`, `add_reasoning_kb_001.py`, `perf_indexes_001_add_performance_indexes.py`) suggest potential:\n   - Schema conflicts or dependency issues\n   - Migration ordering problems\n   - Database connection failures during test setup\n\n2. **Environment/Infrastructure**:\n   - Database connection crashes\n   - Memory exhaustion during migration application\n   - Python interpreter crashes\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Debug Exit Code -1**:\n   ```bash\n   python -m pytest --tb=long -v  # Get detailed traceback\n   python -m pytest --maxfail=1 --pdb  # Debug first failure\n   ```\n\n2. **Isolate Migration Issues**:\n   - Test migrations individually: `alembic upgrade head --sql`\n   - Check database connectivity in test environment\n   - Verify migration dependencies\n\n3. **Infrastructure Check**:\n   - Validate test database setup/teardown\n   - Check for memory leaks in migration scripts\n   - Verify Python environment stability\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Production deployment would be extremely risky:\n- Zero test verification of recent database changes\n- Potential data corruption from faulty migrations\n- Complete unknown of system stability\n- **Recommendation**: Block all deployments until exit code is 0 and basic coverage is restored\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution before addressing coverage gaps.",
