Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely uncaught exception during test setup/execution).\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% coverage** across all files - No tests are executing successfully. This represents maximum coverage risk.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Import/Module Issues**: Recent changes to `perplexity_client.py` and `__init__.py` likely broke test discovery or module loading\n2. **Dependency Problems**: Missing imports, circular dependencies, or broken package structure\n3. **Configuration Errors**: Test runner configuration may be incompatible with new file structure\n\n## Recommendations\n**Immediate Actions (Priority 1):**\n- Fix test discovery: Check `__init__.py` files for proper package structure\n- Verify imports in `perplexity_client.py` aren't causing import errors\n- Run tests with `-v` flag to see exact failure point\n\n**Short-term:**\n- Add basic smoke tests to verify module loading\n- Check test configuration matches new file structure\n- Ensure all dependencies are installed in test environment\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Zero test coverage means:\n- No regression detection for recent changes\n- High probability of undetected bugs in production\n- Deployment carries significant stability risk\n- All code changes are effectively untested\n\n**Critical**: Fix test execution before any further development or deployment.",
