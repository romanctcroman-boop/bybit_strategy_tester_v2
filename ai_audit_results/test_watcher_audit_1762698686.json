    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely uncaught exception during test setup/execution). Zero coverage confirms no tests actually ran.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% coverage across all files** - This represents a complete testing blackout. No code paths were executed, leaving all business logic completely untested.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Breaking changes in `bollinger_mean_reversion.py` or `backtest_engine.py`** that prevent test suite initialization\n2. **Missing dependencies** or environment setup issues\n3. **Syntax errors** in test files or imported modules\n4. **Configuration issues** in test runner (pytest/unittest setup)\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Fix test execution first**:\n   - Run tests with `-v` flag to see specific failure point\n   - Check for import errors in test files\n   - Verify all dependencies are installed\n2. **Restore basic functionality**:\n   - Start with simple smoke tests for core modules\n   - Add minimal unit tests for critical functions\n   - Aim for 70%+ coverage on changed files\n3. **Add regression tests** for Bollinger bands and backtest engine specifically\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deploying these changes would be extremely dangerous:\n- No validation of trading strategy logic\n- Backtest engine modifications completely untested\n- High probability of runtime errors in production\n- Potential financial impact if this is live trading code\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
