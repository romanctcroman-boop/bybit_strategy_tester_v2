    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1). No tests ran successfully, indicating either catastrophic test infrastructure issues or severe code defects preventing test execution.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**ZERO COVERAGE** - 0.00% overall coverage confirms no tests executed. All code paths are untested, including the modified `health_check.py` file.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Syntax/Runtime Errors** in `health_check.py` likely preventing import/execution\n2. **Missing Dependencies** - New imports or requirements not satisfied\n3. **Circular Imports** - Changes may have created import loops\n4. **Configuration Issues** - Test runner configuration broken by changes\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. Run `python -m py_compile health_check.py` to check for syntax errors\n2. Execute `python -c \"import health_check\"` to identify runtime import issues\n3. Review recent changes to `health_check.py` for obvious bugs\n4. Verify test runner configuration and dependencies\n\n**FOLLOW-UP:**\n- Add basic smoke test for `health_check.py` before comprehensive testing\n- Implement CI pipeline that fails fast on syntax/import issues\n- Add static analysis (pylint, mypy) to catch issues pre-commit\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Production deployment would likely fail. The codebase is completely untested and contains at least one breaking change. Without immediate fixes, all subsequent changes will compound existing issues.\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development.",
