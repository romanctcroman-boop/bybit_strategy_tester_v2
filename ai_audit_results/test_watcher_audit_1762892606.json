    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test suite failed to execute (Exit Code -1). No meaningful quality assessment possible as tests didn't run to completion. This indicates fundamental issues in test infrastructure or environment setup.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% coverage** across all files - Tests either crashed immediately or failed to collect any coverage data. Complete coverage gap requiring immediate attention.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe modified files suggest:\n- **`agent_to_agent_api.py`**: Possible breaking changes in API interfaces or dependencies\n- **`key_manager.py`**: Security-related changes that may have introduced configuration or dependency issues\n- **Likely root causes**: Missing dependencies, environment configuration errors, syntax errors, or circular imports\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n1. **Immediate Actions**:\n   - Run tests with `-v` flag to see exact failure point\n   - Check Python environment and dependencies (`pip list`)\n   - Verify no syntax errors in test files or recent code changes\n\n2. **Debugging Steps**:\n   ```bash\n   python -m pytest --collect-only  # Identify test discovery issues\n   python -c \"import backend.api.agent_to_agent_api\"  # Check import errors\n   ```\n\n3. **Infrastructure**:\n   - Add pre-commit hooks to catch syntax errors\n   - Implement CI pipeline with dependency installation steps\n   - Add basic smoke tests for critical modules\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deploying untested code, especially security-related changes in `key_manager.py`, could lead to:\n- Production outages from API failures\n- Security vulnerabilities from untested authentication/encryption logic\n- Data integrity issues from broken agent communications\n\n**Priority**: Resolve test execution issues before any further development or deployment.",
