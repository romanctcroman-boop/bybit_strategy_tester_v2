    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (exit code -1), indicating fundamental issues with the test suite or environment setup. No meaningful quality assessment possible until basic execution is fixed.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% coverage** - All tests failed before coverage could be measured. This represents a complete testing breakdown.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Syntax/Import Errors** in `tests/test_circuit_breaker.py` - Most likely cause\n2. **Missing Dependencies** - Required packages not installed\n3. **Environment Configuration** - Test runner setup issues\n4. **Breaking Changes** - Recent code modifications broke test infrastructure\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. Run `python -m py_compile tests/test_circuit_breaker.py` to check syntax\n2. Execute tests with `-v` flag to see specific failure details\n3. Verify all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n\n**Short-term:**\n- Fix syntax/import issues in the test file\n- Add basic smoke test to verify test execution\n- Implement CI pipeline with dependency installation step\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - No test feedback means:\n- Undetected production bugs likely\n- Code changes cannot be validated\n- Regression risk is extremely high\n- Deployment should be blocked until resolved\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development.",
