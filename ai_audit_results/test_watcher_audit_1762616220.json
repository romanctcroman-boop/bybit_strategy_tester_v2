No tests actually ran successfully.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% coverage** - This is not a coverage gap but a complete test execution failure. The coverage report is empty because no tests completed execution.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **test_enhanced_cross_agent.py** likely contains:\n   - Syntax errors or import failures\n   - Fixture/config setup failures\n   - Environment dependency issues\n   - Infinite loops or crashes during test collection/execution\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. Run tests with `-v` flag to see which specific test fails\n2. Check test logs for Python tracebacks or error messages\n3. Verify all imports and dependencies in the new test file\n4. Test isolation: Run `test_enhanced_cross_agent.py` separately to identify the root cause\n\n**Technical Steps:**\n- Validate test fixtures and setup/teardown methods\n- Check for missing dependencies or environment variables\n- Ensure no infinite loops in test initialization\n- Verify test discovery isn't being blocked\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - The complete test failure means:\n- No validation of recent changes\n- Potential undiscovered regressions\n- Deployment blockers until resolved\n- All existing functionality is currently unverified\n\n**Priority:** Fix immediately - this blocks all other testing and deployment activities.",
