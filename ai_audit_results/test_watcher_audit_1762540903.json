Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure before any tests could execute.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% coverage** confirms no tests ran successfully. This represents a complete testing blackout.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Stress test modifications** likely introduced fatal errors\n2. Possible causes:\n   - Syntax errors in test files\n   - Missing imports/dependencies\n   - Infinite loops or resource exhaustion in parallel execution tests\n   - Environment configuration issues\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **ROLLBACK** stress test changes immediately\n2. Run tests individually to identify the breaking change:\n   ```bash\n   python -m pytest tests/stress/test_parallel_execution.py -v\n   python -m pytest tests/stress/test_memory_leaks.py -v\n   ```\n3. Check for:\n   - Import errors\n   - Resource limits (file handles, memory)\n   - Infinite loops in parallel execution\n4. Add test isolation and timeouts for stress tests\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - No test validation means undetected production issues are likely. Deployment should be blocked until resolved.\n\n**Priority:** Fix test infrastructure before any further development or deployment.",
