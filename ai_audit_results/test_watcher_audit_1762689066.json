    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1) with 0% coverage. This indicates either catastrophic test infrastructure issues or severe code defects preventing any tests from running.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **Total failure**: 0% coverage across all files\n- **No files executed**: Coverage report is empty\n- **Critical gap**: Unable to assess actual code coverage due to execution failure\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe failure likely stems from `run_full_project_audit.py` changes:\n- Syntax errors preventing import/execution\n- Missing dependencies or imports\n- Infinite loops or fatal exceptions\n- Environment configuration issues\n- Test runner configuration broken\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. **Debug test execution**: Run tests with `-v` flag to see specific failure point\n2. **Check syntax**: Validate `run_full_project_audit.py` for basic Python syntax\n3. **Isolate the issue**: Run minimal test case to identify root cause\n4. **Review recent commits**: Focus on changes to test infrastructure and imports\n\n**Process Improvements:**\n1. Add pre-commit syntax checking\n2. Implement smoke tests for test infrastructure\n3. Add test environment validation\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- No reliable test feedback\n- Potential production-breaking changes undetected\n- Complete loss of quality assurance\n- Urgent attention required before any further deployments\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution immediately before addressing any other development tasks.",
