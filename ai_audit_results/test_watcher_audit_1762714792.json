No tests ran successfully, indicating either:\n- Syntax errors in test files\n- Import/dependency failures\n- Test framework configuration issues\n- Fatal errors during test discovery/setup\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This represents a complete testing failure, not just low coverage.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe changed file `tests/test_perplexity_client.py` likely contains:\n- Broken imports or syntax errors\n- Missing dependencies for Perplexity client\n- Configuration errors in test setup/teardown\n- Test discovery failures\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Fix Test Execution First**\n   - Run `python -m pytest tests/test_perplexity_client.py -v` to see specific errors\n   - Check for syntax errors in the test file\n   - Verify all imports and dependencies are available\n\n2. **Debug Steps**\n   - Add `print(\"Test starting\")` at top of test file to verify execution\n   - Check pytest configuration and conftest.py files\n   - Verify Python environment and installed packages\n\n3. **Validation**\n   - Once tests run, focus on achieving meaningful coverage\n   - Ensure Perplexity client integration is properly mocked/tested\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - No test validation means:\n- Undetected regressions in Perplexity client integration\n- Potential production failures in API interactions\n- No safety net for related code changes\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development on this component.",
