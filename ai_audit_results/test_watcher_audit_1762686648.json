No tests ran successfully, indicating fundamental infrastructure or configuration issues rather than test logic problems.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% coverage** - No code was executed during testing. This represents a complete testing blackout, making all code changes effectively untested.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe failure coincides with changes to `tests\\backend\\conftest.py`, suggesting:\n- **Pytest configuration corruption** - Fixtures, hooks, or plugin configurations may be broken\n- **Import/dependency issues** - Critical imports failing in test setup\n- **Environment misconfiguration** - Test environment requirements not met\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions (Next 2 hours):**\n1. **Debug conftest.py** - Comment out recent changes to isolate the breaking modification\n2. **Check pytest output** - Run with `-v` flag to see specific error before exit\n3. **Verify dependencies** - Ensure all test requirements are installed and compatible\n\n**Short-term (Next day):**\n1. **Add pre-commit test validation** - Prevent broken test configurations from merging\n2. **Implement smoke tests** - Basic tests that validate test infrastructure\n3. **Create test environment checklist** - Document required setup steps\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state means:\n- All production code changes are untested\n- Critical bugs could reach production undetected\n- Team velocity blocked until resolved\n- Technical debt accumulating rapidly\n\n**Priority: CRITICAL** - Fix test infrastructure immediately before any further development.",
