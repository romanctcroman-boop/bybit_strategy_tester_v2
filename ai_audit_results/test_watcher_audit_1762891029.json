    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely unhandled exception or environment crash). No tests executed successfully.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - All code changes are completely untested. No coverage data generated suggests tests never reached execution phase.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **fix_datetime_utcnow.py changes likely introduced breaking changes** that prevent test execution\n2. Possible issues:\n   - Syntax errors in modified code\n   - Import/circular dependency problems\n   - Environment configuration conflicts\n   - Critical exceptions during module import\n\n## Recommendations\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. **Fix test execution first** - Run tests with verbose output to identify crash cause\n2. **Check syntax** - Validate `fix_datetime_utcnow.py` for basic Python syntax\n3. **Test isolation** - Run minimal test to verify basic functionality\n4. **Add error handling** - Ensure tests handle exceptions gracefully\n\n**FOLLOW-UP:**\n- Implement basic smoke tests for datetime functionality\n- Add unit tests covering UTC datetime scenarios\n- Set up pre-commit hooks to catch syntax issues\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Production deployment would be extremely risky:\n- Zero test coverage means unknown behavior\n- Critical failure suggests fundamental code issues\n- No validation of datetime logic changes\n- Potential for runtime crashes in production\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
