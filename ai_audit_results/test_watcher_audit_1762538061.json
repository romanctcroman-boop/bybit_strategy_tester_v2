This represents a complete testing blackout.\n\n## Potential Issues\n1. **Test Harness Failure**: Exit code -1 suggests environment/dependency issues\n2. **Integration Break**: Recent changes to `test_audit_agent_integration.py` likely broke the test runner\n3. **Missing Dependencies**: Possible missing imports, configuration, or service dependencies\n4. **Syntax/Import Errors**: File may contain fatal Python errors preventing execution\n\n## Immediate Actions Required\n1. **Fix Test Execution First**:\n   - Check for Python syntax errors in the modified test file\n   - Verify all imports and dependencies are available\n   - Run tests with `-v` flag to see specific failure points\n\n2. **Validate Test Environment**:\n   - Ensure test database/API dependencies are running\n   - Check environment variables and configuration files\n   - Verify Python path and module structure\n\n3. **Rollback Strategy**:\n   - Consider temporarily reverting the changed test file\n   - Isolate the integration test from main test suite if unstable\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Zero test coverage means:\n- No validation of recent changes\n- Potential undetected regressions in production code\n- Broken deployment pipeline\n- All existing functionality is currently unverified\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
