    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely segmentation fault, environment crash, or fatal Python error). Test infrastructure itself is broken.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% coverage** means:\n- No tests executed successfully\n- All recovery scenarios untested\n- Complete testing blackout for critical failure recovery paths\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe 3 modified recovery test files likely contain:\n- Fatal import errors or syntax errors\n- Environment-destroying operations (disk filling, process killing)\n- Missing test dependencies or setup\n- Infinite loops or resource exhaustion\n- Corrupted test fixtures/teardown\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate (Next 30 minutes):**\n1. Run tests individually to identify which file causes the crash\n2. Check test logs for stack traces or error messages\n3. Verify test environment isolation and resource limits\n\n**Short-term (Today):**\n1. Add proper error handling in recovery tests\n2. Implement resource cleanup in test teardown\n3. Add test timeouts and resource monitoring\n4. Create isolated test environments for destructive operations\n\n**Long-term:**\n1. Implement staged test execution (safe tests first)\n2. Add pre-flight checks for destructive tests\n3. Monitor test resource consumption\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Recovery mechanisms are completely untested. Any of these scenarios in production could cause:\n- Data loss or corruption\n- System downtime\n- Cascading failures\n- Inability to recover from expected failure conditions\n\n**Priority:** Fix immediately - this represents a complete testing breakdown that masks potential production failures.",
