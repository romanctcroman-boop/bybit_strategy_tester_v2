No tests ran successfully, indicating either:\n- Syntax errors in test files\n- Missing dependencies or imports\n- Test framework configuration issues\n- Fatal errors during test discovery/setup\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code coverage was collected because:\n- Tests failed before execution could begin\n- No production code was exercised\n- Coverage reporting failed entirely\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe modified file `tests/test_deepseek_client.py` likely contains:\n- Breaking syntax errors\n- Missing imports or dependencies\n- Incorrect test configuration\n- Circular imports or module loading issues\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. Run `python -m pytest tests/test_deepseek_client.py -v` to see specific error details\n2. Check for syntax errors in the test file\n3. Verify all imports and dependencies are available\n4. Ensure test framework (pytest) is properly installed\n\n**Follow-up:**\n5. Fix the failing test before any deployment\n6. Add pre-commit hooks to catch syntax errors\n7. Implement CI pipeline that fails fast on syntax issues\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state prevents:\n- Any quality assurance\n- Regression detection\n- Code coverage validation\n- Confidence in recent changes\n\n**Priority:** Fix immediately before proceeding with development or deployment.",
