    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1). This indicates fundamental issues with the test infrastructure or test code itself, making quality assessment impossible until basic execution is resolved.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% coverage** - All tests failed to execute, meaning no code was actually tested. This represents a complete testing blackout.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n- **test_priority_1_unified_client.py** is the only changed file and likely contains syntax errors, import failures, or configuration issues\n- Possible causes: Missing dependencies, broken imports, infinite loops, environment configuration errors\n- Test runner may be crashing before any tests execute\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. Run `python -m pytest test_priority_1_unified_client.py -v` to see specific error details\n2. Check for syntax errors: `python -m py_compile test_priority_1_unified_client.py`\n3. Verify imports and dependencies are correctly installed\n\n**Follow-up:**\n4. Add test discovery validation to CI pipeline\n5. Implement basic smoke tests to catch execution failures early\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - No tests are running, meaning all code changes are effectively untested. This could allow critical bugs to reach production undetected. The testing pipeline is currently providing false confidence.\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
