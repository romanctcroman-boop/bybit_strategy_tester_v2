    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1). No meaningful test quality can be assessed since tests didn't run to completion. This indicates either catastrophic test infrastructure issues or severe code defects preventing test execution.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0.00% coverage** - No code was executed during testing. This represents a complete testing failure, not just poor coverage.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe circuit_breaker.py modification likely introduced:\n- **Syntax errors** preventing module import/execution\n- **Import/dependency issues** breaking the module\n- **Runtime exceptions** during test setup/import\n- **Configuration errors** in test environment\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n1. **Immediate Action:**\n   - Fix the syntax/import errors in circuit_breaker.py\n   - Run basic syntax check: `python -m py_compile backend\\api\\circuit_breaker.py`\n   - Verify imports and dependencies\n\n2. **Testing Infrastructure:**\n   - Add pre-commit hooks for syntax validation\n   - Implement basic smoke tests before full test suite\n   - Ensure test environment matches development environment\n\n3. **Process Improvements:**\n   - Require all changes to pass basic syntax checks before commit\n   - Add unit tests specifically for circuit_breaker functionality\n   - Implement gradual rollout with canary testing\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - The codebase is currently untestable and potentially broken in production. Circuit breaker patterns are critical for system resilience - any defects here could cause cascading failures across the entire system.\n\n**Priority:** Fix immediately before any deployment.",
