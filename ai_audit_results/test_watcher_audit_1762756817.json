No tests executed successfully.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% coverage** - No code was executed during testing. This represents maximum risk - we have zero visibility into code functionality or regression.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe single changed file (`enhanced_mcp_router.py`) likely contains:\n- Syntax errors preventing import/execution\n- Missing dependencies or imports\n- Runtime exceptions during module loading\n- Infinite loops or fatal errors on initialization\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. **Fix test execution** - Run tests with verbose output to identify the crash cause\n2. **Add basic smoke test** - Create minimal test that imports the module without executing logic\n3. **Check dependencies** - Verify all required packages are installed and compatible\n\n**Short-term:**\n4. **Add exception handling** - Wrap risky operations with try/catch blocks\n5. **Implement logging** - Add debug logs to trace execution flow\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**SEVERITY: CRITICAL**\n- **Deployment Risk:** Extremely high - cannot verify any functionality\n- **Regression Risk:** Maximum - no protection against breaking changes\n- **Business Impact:** Complete uncertainty about system stability\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
