Implement test logging to capture execution failures\n2. Add pre-flight checks for external dependencies (Docker, databases)\n3. Create isolated unit tests before integration tests\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- **Zero test reliability** - No confidence in code changes\n- **Production readiness unknown** - Untested code poses deployment risks\n- **Regression detection impossible** - No baseline for future changes\n- **Critical path blocked** - Development workflow halted until resolved\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development.",
