Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely uncaught exception during test setup/execution).\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% coverage** - No code is being executed during tests. This represents complete test infrastructure failure.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n- `parallel_audit_submission.py` changes likely introduced breaking changes\n- Possible syntax errors, import failures, or runtime exceptions\n- Test environment/dependencies may be incompatible with new code\n- Test runner configuration may be broken\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. **Fix test execution** - Run tests with verbose output to identify the root cause\n2. **Check syntax** - Validate `parallel_audit_submission.py` for basic Python syntax\n3. **Verify imports** - Ensure all dependencies are available and compatible\n4. **Test isolation** - Run minimal test to confirm basic functionality\n\n**Follow-up:**\n5. Add basic smoke test to prevent complete test suite collapse\n6. Implement CI pipeline that fails fast on syntax/import issues\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Code is completely untested and potentially non-functional. Deployment would be extremely risky.\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
