    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates the test runner crashed before executing any tests. This represents a complete testing breakdown.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% coverage** - No code was executed during testing. All test infrastructure has failed.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **File `full_ai_audit_deepseek_perplexity_deepseek.py` likely contains fatal errors** preventing test execution\n2. **Syntax errors** or **import failures** in the changed file\n3. **Missing dependencies** or **environment configuration issues**\n4. **Test runner configuration** may be broken\n\n## Immediate Action Recommendations\n1. **Fix the crash first** - Run the file directly to identify syntax/runtime errors:\n   ```bash\n   python full_ai_audit_deepseek_perplexity_deepseek.py\n   ```\n2. **Check imports and dependencies** - Verify all required packages are installed\n3. **Validate test configuration** - Ensure pytest/unittest configuration is correct\n4. **Add basic smoke test** - Create a minimal test that verifies the module can be imported\n5. **Implement error handling** - Add try-catch blocks around critical operations\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Code is completely untested and potentially unstable. Deployment would be extremely risky. The entire test suite is compromised until the crash is resolved.\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution crash before any other development continues.",
