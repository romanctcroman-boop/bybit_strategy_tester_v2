The test suite is non-functional.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **0% coverage** - No code was executed successfully\n- **Complete gap** - All test execution failed before coverage could be measured\n- **Critical infrastructure failure** - Unable to assess actual code coverage\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **tests\\test_edge_cases_stress.py** likely contains code that:\n   - Crashes the test runner (syntax errors, import failures)\n   - Contains infinite loops or resource exhaustion\n   - Has severe memory leaks or system resource issues\n   - Modifies critical test infrastructure\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **ROLLBACK** the recent test file changes immediately\n2. **Isolate the problematic test** by running it separately: `python -m pytest tests/test_edge_cases_stress.py -v`\n3. **Check for syntax errors**: `python -m py_compile tests/test_edge_cases_stress.py`\n4. **Add test isolation** - Ensure stress tests run in separate processes with resource limits\n5. **Implement test staging** - Run new tests in isolation before full suite integration\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state:\n- ❌ No test coverage validation\n- ❌ Unable to detect regressions\n- ❌ Development pipeline blocked\n- ❌ Production deployment risky\n\n**Priority**: Fix immediately - this blocks all quality assurance and deployment activities.",
