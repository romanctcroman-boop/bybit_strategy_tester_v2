    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test suite is completely broken:\n- Exit code -1 indicates abnormal termination (likely unhandled exception)\n- Zero test execution suggests fundamental infrastructure issues\n- No coverage data collected implies tests never ran properly\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**NO COVERAGE DATA** - All files show 0.00% coverage:\n- Tests likely crash during setup/import phase\n- Cannot assess actual code coverage without successful test execution\n- All reliability and client code completely untested in this run\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Import/Dependency Issues** - New client files (`deepseek_client.py`) may have broken imports\n2. **Configuration Problems** - Test runner configuration may be invalid\n3. **Circular Dependencies** - Integration between retry logic and client code\n4. **Missing Requirements** - New dependencies not installed in test environment\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. Run tests individually to identify crashing test:\n   ```bash\n   python -m pytest tests/test_perplexity_client.py -v\n   ```\n2. Check test environment setup and dependency installation\n3. Verify all imports in new client files work correctly\n4. Add try/catch blocks in test setup to capture initialization errors\n\n**FOLLOW-UP:**\n- Implement basic smoke tests before complex integration tests\n- Add test logging to capture initialization failures\n- Set up CI to fail fast on environment issues\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- Production reliability features (circuit breaker, retry logic) are untested\n- Client implementations may have runtime errors\n- No confidence in recent changes to reliability layer\n- Potential for silent failures in production\n\n**Priority:** Fix test infrastructure immediately before any further development.",
