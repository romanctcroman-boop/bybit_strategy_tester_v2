Zero coverage suggests tests didn't even start running properly.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **0% coverage** across all files\n- No test execution occurred despite file modifications\n- Complete absence of any test data collection\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **run_full_project_audit.py** - Likely contains the test runner that's failing to execute\n2. **backend\\services\\deepseek_agent.py** - Recent changes may have introduced breaking dependencies or import errors\n3. Possible causes:\n   - Missing dependencies or environment setup\n   - Syntax errors in test files\n   - Configuration issues in test runner\n   - Circular imports or module loading failures\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Debug Exit Code -1**: Check test runner logs for specific error messages\n2. **Verify Dependencies**: Ensure all required packages are installed and compatible\n3. **Test Isolation**: Run tests for individual files to identify which component is failing\n4. **Environment Check**: Validate Python version, path configurations, and import statements\n5. **Add Basic Smoke Test**: Create a minimal test that verifies the test framework itself works\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - The complete test failure means:\n- No validation of recent changes to critical files\n- Potential production-breaking issues undetected\n- Zero confidence in current code quality\n- Urgent attention required before any deployment\n\n**Priority Action**: Fix the test execution failure before addressing coverage gaps.",
