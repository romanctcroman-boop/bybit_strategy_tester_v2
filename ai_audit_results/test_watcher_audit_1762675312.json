No tests ran successfully, indicating fundamental issues with the test infrastructure or environment setup.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% coverage** - No code was executed during testing. This represents a complete testing failure, not just low coverage.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n- **conftest.py modifications likely broke test infrastructure** - Changes to this pytest configuration file appear to have introduced fatal errors\n- **Possible issues**: Syntax errors, import failures, fixture conflicts, or environment dependencies\n- **Test discovery failure** - Pytest cannot locate or execute any tests\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n1. **Immediate**: Revert `tests\\backend\\conftest.py` changes and verify tests run\n2. **Debug**: Run `pytest -v tests/backend/ --tb=short` to identify specific failure points\n3. **Validate**: Check Python environment, dependencies, and pytest version compatibility\n4. **Isolate**: Test conftest changes in isolation before full test suite execution\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - \n- No test validation of code changes\n- Potential for undetected regressions in production\n- Broken CI/CD pipeline\n- All code changes are effectively untested\n\n**Priority**: Fix immediately before any further deployments.",
