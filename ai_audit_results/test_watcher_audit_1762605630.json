    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1) with 0% coverage. This indicates either:\n- Syntax/runtime errors preventing test execution\n- Test framework configuration issues\n- Critical failures in test setup/teardown\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**COMPLETE COVERAGE FAILURE** - 0% coverage across all files suggests:\n- No tests actually executed\n- Possible import/module resolution failures\n- Test discovery mechanism broken\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe changed files suggest:\n1. **`test_memory_leaks.py`** - Likely contains memory leak detection that's failing catastrophically\n2. **`advanced_architecture.py`** - Architectural changes may have broken test imports or dependencies\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. Run tests with `-v` flag to see which specific test is failing\n2. Check Python syntax in both changed files: `python -m py_compile [filename]`\n3. Verify imports and dependencies in test files\n4. Run a single simple test to isolate the failure point\n\n**FOLLOW-UP:**\n5. Add basic smoke tests that run before complex memory leak detection\n6. Implement test isolation to prevent cascade failures\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state provides zero confidence in code quality:\n- No functional validation occurring\n- Memory leak detection completely broken\n- Potential undetected regressions in production code\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development.",
