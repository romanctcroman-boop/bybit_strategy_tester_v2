Possible issues:\n   - Missing dependencies or imports\n   - Environment variables not set\n   - Database/API connections failing\n   - Syntax errors in test code\n   - Circular imports\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Debug the integration test failure:**\n   ```bash\n   python -m pytest tests/test_audit_agent_integration.py -v\n   ```\n2. Check for missing imports in the integration test file\n3. Verify all required services (databases, APIs) are running\n4. Review recent changes to the integration test for syntax errors\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - No tests are running, meaning:\n- All code changes are effectively untested\n- Regression risks are extremely high\n- Deployment would be dangerous\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
