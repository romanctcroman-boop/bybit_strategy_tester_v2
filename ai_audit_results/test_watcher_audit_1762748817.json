    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1) with zero coverage. This indicates fundamental issues preventing any meaningful test execution.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **Total Coverage: 0%** - No code was executed during testing\n- **Missing Coverage: 100%** - All code paths remain untested\n- **Root Cause**: Likely fatal error during test setup/import preventing any test execution\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Syntax/Import Errors** in `test_perplexity_client.py` or dependencies\n2. **Missing Dependencies** - Required packages not installed\n3. **Configuration Issues** - Test runner setup problems\n4. **Environment Issues** - Python version conflicts or path problems\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. Run `python -m pytest tests/test_perplexity_client.py -v` to see specific error details\n2. Check for syntax errors in the test file\n3. Verify all imports (`from perplexity_client import ...`) are correct\n4. Ensure test dependencies are installed\n\n**Follow-up:**\n5. Fix the fatal error first, then assess actual test coverage\n6. Add basic smoke tests to prevent complete test suite failure\n7. Implement CI pipeline that fails fast on import/syntax errors\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - No test validation is occurring. Any bugs in production code would go undetected. Code changes are essentially untested, posing significant deployment risks.\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution immediately before any further development.",
