    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1). This indicates either:\n- Syntax errors in test files or implementation\n- Critical runtime exceptions during test setup/execution\n- Missing dependencies or configuration issues\n- Test framework misconfiguration\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**ZERO COVERAGE** - 0.00% coverage across all files confirms no tests executed successfully. This represents a complete testing breakdown.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe modified files suggest:\n1. **`retry_policy.py`** - Likely introduced breaking changes in retry logic or error handling\n2. **`distributed_rate_limiter.py`** - Possibly added complex distributed system dependencies that aren't properly handled in tests\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. **Fix Test Execution First**\n   - Check test runner configuration and dependencies\n   - Run tests with `-v` flag to identify specific failure points\n   - Verify Python environment and package versions\n\n2. **Isolate the Failure**\n   ```bash\n   python -m pytest reliability/ --tb=short -x\n   ```\n\n3. **Add Basic Smoke Tests**\n   - Create minimal tests that verify module imports and basic functionality\n   - Focus on the two changed files first\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deploying these changes would be extremely dangerous:\n- No validation of retry policy logic changes\n- Distributed rate limiter changes completely untested\n- Potential production failures in critical reliability components\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
