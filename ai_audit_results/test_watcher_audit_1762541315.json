    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1) with zero coverage. This indicates fundamental issues in the test environment or test code structure.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **Total Coverage: 0.00%** - No code was executed during testing\n- **No coverage data available** - Tests didn't reach execution phase\n- **Critical gap**: Entire test suite is non-functional\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Test file modifications** in `tests/recovery/` likely introduced:\n   - Syntax errors in test code\n   - Import failures or circular dependencies\n   - Environment setup/teardown issues\n   - Fixture configuration problems\n\n2. **Possible root causes**:\n   - Missing dependencies in recovery test modules\n   - Infinite loops or resource exhaustion\n   - Test discovery/collection failures\n   - Environment variable misconfiguration\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. Run tests individually to isolate failing module:\n   ```bash\n   python -m pytest tests/recovery/test_disk_full.py -v\n   python -m pytest tests/recovery/test_network_failure.py -v\n   ```\n\n2. Check for syntax errors:\n   ```bash\n   python -m py_compile tests/recovery/test_disk_full.py\n   python -m py_compile tests/recovery/test_network_failure.py\n   ```\n\n3. Review recent changes to recovery test files for:\n   - Import statements\n   - Fixture definitions\n   - Mock configurations\n   - Environment dependencies\n\n**Systematic Fixes:**\n- Add pre-commit hooks for syntax validation\n- Implement test isolation patterns\n- Add integration test monitoring\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- No reliable test feedback\n- Potential undetected regressions\n- Recovery mechanism testing completely broken\n- Deployment readiness compromised\n\n**Priority**: Resolve immediately before any further development or deployment.",
