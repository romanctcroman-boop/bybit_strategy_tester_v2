This indicates fundamental problems with the test infrastructure or codebase, not just test failures.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **0% coverage** across all files\n- No coverage data collected due to test execution failure\n- Complete testing blackout - unable to assess any functional coverage\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe single changed file `tests\\test_integration_full.py` likely contains:\n- Syntax errors preventing test discovery/execution\n- Import errors or circular dependencies\n- Fixture/setup code that crashes before any tests run\n- Environment/dependency issues in integration tests\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. Run `python -m pytest tests/test_integration_full.py -v` to see specific error details\n2. Check for syntax errors: `python -m py_compile tests/test_integration_full.py`\n3. Verify imports and dependencies in the integration test file\n\n**Follow-up:**\n4. Add a basic smoke test that runs before integration tests\n5. Implement test isolation - ensure integration tests don't crash entire test suite\n6. Set up test environment validation in CI pipeline\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Complete testing failure means:\n- No validation of recent changes\n- Potential undiscovered regressions\n- Deployment blocking until resolved\n- Possible production issues if deployed without testing\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
