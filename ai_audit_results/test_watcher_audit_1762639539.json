No tests executed successfully.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This represents complete test infrastructure failure rather than coverage gaps.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Server.py modifications** likely introduced fatal errors:\n   - Syntax errors preventing import/execution\n   - Missing dependencies or imports\n   - Infinite loops or blocking operations\n   - Environment configuration breaks\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Debug test runner**: Check for import errors, missing test dependencies, or configuration issues\n2. **Validate server.py syntax**: Run `python -m py_compile mcp-server/server.py`\n3. **Test isolation**: Run minimal test case to verify basic functionality\n4. **Check test configuration**: Ensure pytest/unittest setup isn't broken by recent changes\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Code is completely untested. Deployment would be extremely risky. Recent server.py changes may have introduced breaking changes affecting entire system.\n\n**Priority Action**: Fix test execution before any further development or deployment.",
