Run tests individually to identify which file causes the failure\n2. Check for syntax errors: `python -m py_compile automation/deepseek_robot/*.py`\n3. Verify imports and dependencies are properly installed\n4. Run with verbose output: `pytest -v automation/deepseek_robot/`\n\n**Follow-up:**\n1. Fix the root cause preventing test execution\n2. Add basic smoke tests to validate test infrastructure\n3. Implement CI checks for test execution failures\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Unable to validate any functionality or detect regressions. Code changes cannot be safely deployed without working test suite. Memory leak detection (indicated by test filename) is completely non-functional.",
