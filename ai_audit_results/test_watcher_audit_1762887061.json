No meaningful quality assessment possible as zero tests ran successfully.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**COMPLETE COVERAGE FAILURE** - 0.00% coverage suggests:\n- Tests cannot execute due to configuration/environment issues\n- Import failures or dependency problems\n- Test discovery completely broken\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n**Primary suspects in modified files:**\n- `tests\\backend\\conftest.py`: Likely contains broken fixtures, improper imports, or configuration that prevents test execution\n- `tests\\unit\\test_batch_writer.py`: May contain syntax errors, missing imports, or incompatible test structure\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. **Debug test execution**: Run `pytest -v` to see specific error messages\n2. **Check conftest.py**: Verify fixture definitions and imports\n3. **Validate test_batch_writer.py**: Check for syntax errors and dependencies\n4. **Run tests individually**: Isolate which file causes the failure\n\n**Technical Steps:**\n- Run `pytest tests/backend/conftest.py --collect-only` to check fixture loading\n- Execute `python -m py_compile tests/unit/test_batch_writer.py` to verify syntax\n- Check pytest configuration and required dependencies\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Complete test failure means:\n- No validation of recent changes\n- Potential production-breaking code could be deployed\n- All existing functionality is unverified\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
