    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test suite is completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely segmentation fault, environment crash, or fatal Python error). Zero coverage suggests tests aren't even executing.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **Total Coverage: 0%** - No code is being tested\n- **No file-specific coverage data** - Execution halting before coverage collection\n- **Critical gap**: Entire test infrastructure is compromised\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **MTF Engine changes** (`mtf_engine.py`) likely introduced fatal errors\n2. **Database query optimization tests** may be causing environment crashes\n3. **Sandbox integration** could be triggering fatal system interactions\n4. **Protocol changes** might be incompatible with test environment\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. **Isolate the crash**: Run tests individually to identify which file causes the -1 exit\n2. **Check environment**: Verify Python installation, dependencies, and memory limits\n3. **Add debug logging**: Insert try/catch blocks and print statements in test setup\n\n**Short-term:**\n4. **Rollback recent MTF engine changes** and test incrementally\n5. **Run with `-v` flag** to see which test executes last before crash\n6. **Check for infinite loops** or memory exhaustion in batch writer/protocol tests\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- Production deployment would be extremely risky\n- No regression detection capability\n- Potential for undetected critical bugs\n- Development is effectively flying blind\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution before any further feature development.",
