    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely unhandled exception or system error). No tests executed successfully.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This represents complete test infrastructure failure rather than coverage gaps.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Server.py modifications** likely introduced fatal errors:\n   - Syntax errors preventing import/execution\n   - Missing dependencies or imports\n   - Infinite loops or fatal exceptions on initialization\n   - Environment/config issues from changes\n\n## Recommendations\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. Run tests with `-v` flag to see specific failure reason\n2. Check server.py for syntax errors: `python -m py_compile mcp-server/server.py`\n3. Verify imports and dependencies are intact\n4. Add try/catch around test initialization to capture errors\n\n**STRUCTURAL FIXES:**\n1. Implement basic smoke test to validate test environment\n2. Add test logging to capture initialization failures\n3. Create health check test that runs before coverage measurement\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Production deployment would be extremely dangerous:\n- No validation of recent server.py changes\n- Complete unknown if code functions at all\n- Potential for runtime crashes in production\n- Zero confidence in system stability\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
