    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1). No meaningful testing occurred. This indicates either:\n- Syntax errors in test files or code\n- Missing dependencies/environment setup\n- Test framework configuration issues\n- Fatal errors during test discovery/import\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This is a direct result of test execution failure, not a coverage measurement issue.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n- `health_check.py` modifications likely introduced breaking changes\n- Possible syntax errors, import issues, or runtime exceptions\n- Environment/dependency mismatches\n- Test configuration broken by recent changes\n\n## Recommendations\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. **Fix test execution** - Run tests with verbose output to identify the root cause\n2. **Check syntax** - Validate `health_check.py` for Python syntax compliance\n3. **Verify imports** - Ensure all dependencies are available and compatible\n4. **Test isolation** - Run tests for `health_check.py` separately to isolate the issue\n\n**Follow-up:**\n5. Once tests execute, establish baseline coverage for `health_check.py`\n6. Add specific tests for new functionality in recent changes\n7. Implement CI checks to prevent similar failures\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Code is completely untested. Any defects in `health_check.py` are undetected, posing significant reliability and deployment risks. Production deployment should be blocked until tests execute successfully and achieve meaningful coverage.\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
