    "analysis": "Based on the test results, here are the key insights:\n\n## 1. Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely broken:\n- Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic test framework failure\n- 0% coverage suggests tests aren't executing properly\n- Likely environment or dependency issues preventing test execution\n\n## 2. Coverage Analysis\n**NO COVERAGE DATA** - This is a major red flag:\n- Coverage reporting system failed entirely\n- Cannot assess which code paths are tested\n- Impossible to identify untested functionality\n\n## 3. Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n- **Modified test framework files** (conftest.py, terminal.py) may have broken test infrastructure\n- **Multiple test files changed** simultaneously suggests widespread refactoring\n- **Virtual environment file modified** (.venv) indicates dependency conflicts\n- **Test execution pipeline failure** rather than individual test failures\n\n## 4. Immediate Recommendations\n**Priority 1 - Fix Test Infrastructure:**\n- Revert changes to pytest files (conftest.py, terminal.py)\n- Check virtual environment integrity\n- Run minimal test to verify framework functionality\n\n**Priority 2 - Isolate the Break:**\n- Run tests individually to identify which change broke execution\n- Check for circular imports or dependency conflicts\n- Verify all test dependencies are properly installed\n\n**Priority 3 - Restore Coverage:**\n- Fix coverage reporting once tests execute\n- Focus on core modules first (walk_forward_optimizer, retrain_scheduler)\n\n## 5. Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state is unacceptable for deployment:\n- No confidence in code changes\n- Potential for undetected regressions\n- Development blocked until resolved\n- **Do not merge** any changes until test infrastructure is restored\n\n**Immediate Action:** Roll back recent test framework modifications and verify basic test execution works before proceeding.",
