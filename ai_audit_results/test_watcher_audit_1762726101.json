    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test suite failed to execute (Exit Code -1). No meaningful quality assessment possible as tests didn't run. This indicates either catastrophic test infrastructure issues or severe code defects preventing test execution.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0.00% coverage** - No code was executed during testing. This is a direct result of the test execution failure, not a coverage measurement issue.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe single changed file `simplified_reliable_mcp.py` likely contains:\n- **Syntax errors** preventing import/execution\n- **Missing dependencies** causing import failures  \n- **Runtime errors** during module initialization\n- **Infinite loops** or **blocking operations** during import\n- **Circular imports** breaking the module structure\n\n## Immediate Action Recommendations\n1. **Fix test execution first** - Run tests with verbose output to identify the root cause\n2. **Check syntax** - Run `python -m py_compile simplified_reliable_mcp.py`\n3. **Test imports** - Attempt `import simplified_reliable_mcp` in isolation\n4. **Add basic smoke test** - Create a minimal test that imports and instantiates the module\n5. **Review recent changes** - Compare against previous working version\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - The codebase is currently untestable and likely non-functional. Deployment would be extremely risky. Without functioning tests, regression detection is impossible and code quality cannot be verified.\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or analysis.",
