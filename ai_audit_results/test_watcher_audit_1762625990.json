No tests executed successfully.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This represents complete testing failure, not just low coverage.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Server.py modifications** likely introduced:\n   - Fatal import errors or circular dependencies\n   - Syntax errors preventing module loading\n   - Environment/config requirements not met\n   - Critical exceptions in module-level code\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Run tests with verbose output** to see the actual error:\n   ```bash\n   python -m pytest -v --tb=short\n   ```\n\n2. **Check server.py for:**\n   - Missing imports or dependencies\n   - Syntax errors in recent changes\n   - Module-level code that might crash\n   - Environment variable requirements\n\n3. **Validate the test environment:**\n   - Required packages installed\n   - Configuration files present\n   - Database/services accessible\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Code is completely untested and potentially broken. Deployment would be extremely risky. The server may not even start successfully.\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
