Isolate the failing test: `pytest tests/integration/test_real_api_integration.py -v`\n2. Check for missing imports or dependencies in the test file\n3. Verify mock data/setup fixtures are properly configured\n4. Ensure API rate limits aren't being exceeded\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Integration tests are failing completely, meaning:\n- No validation of API integrations\n- Potential production-breaking changes could go undetected\n- Critical business functionality may be compromised\n- **Immediate attention required** before any deployment\n\n**Priority:** Fix integration test execution before proceeding with further development or deployments.",
