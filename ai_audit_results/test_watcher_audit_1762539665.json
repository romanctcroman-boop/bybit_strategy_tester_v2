    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely unhandled exception or environment crash). Zero coverage confirms no tests executed successfully.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **Total Coverage: 0%** - No code was executed during test run\n- **No file-specific coverage data** - Tests failed before any coverage collection\n- **Critical gap**: Entire test suite is blocked from running\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Integration test failure** (`test_e2e_audit_agent.py`) likely contains breaking changes\n2. **Backend API changes** (`app.py`) may have introduced fatal errors\n3. **Environment/dependency issues** preventing test execution\n4. **Configuration errors** in test setup or teardown\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Fix blocking issue first** - Run tests with `-v` flag to see exact failure point\n2. **Check recent commits** to `tests/integration/test_e2e_audit_agent.py` and `backend/api/app.py`\n3. **Verify dependencies** - Ensure all required packages are installed and compatible\n4. **Add try/catch blocks** in test setup to capture and log initialization errors\n5. **Implement smoke test** to validate basic test environment functionality\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deployment would be completely untested. Critical issues could reach production undetected. No regression protection exists until tests are restored.\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
