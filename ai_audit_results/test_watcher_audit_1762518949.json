    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1). No meaningful quality assessment possible as tests didn't run to completion. This indicates either catastrophic test infrastructure issues or severe code defects preventing test execution.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This represents a complete testing blackout, making it impossible to assess actual code coverage or identify coverage gaps.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n- **server.py modifications likely introduced fatal errors** preventing test execution\n- Possible issues: syntax errors, import failures, infinite loops, or environment dependencies\n- Test framework may be unable to load/execute due to broken module structure\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n1. **IMMEDIATE: Fix test execution**\n   - Run `python -m py_compile mcp-server/server.py` to check for syntax errors\n   - Verify imports and dependencies are intact\n   - Check for infinite loops or blocking operations\n\n2. **PRIORITY: Isolate the failure**\n   - Run minimal test: `python -c \"from mcp-server import server\"`\n   - Execute tests with `-v` flag for detailed failure information\n   - Check test configuration and environment setup\n\n3. **ESTABLISH BASELINE**\n   - Get at least one test passing to establish 0% → measurable coverage\n   - Focus on critical path testing first\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Production deployment would be extremely risky:\n- Unknown if code is functionally correct\n- No regression protection\n- Potential for runtime failures in production\n- Complete lack of quality metrics\n\n**Action:** Block deployments until basic test execution is restored and >70% coverage achieved.",
