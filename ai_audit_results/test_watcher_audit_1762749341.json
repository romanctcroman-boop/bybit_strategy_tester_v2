    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1). No tests ran successfully, indicating either:\n- Syntax errors in test files or code\n- Missing dependencies/environment setup\n- Test framework configuration issues\n- Fatal errors during test discovery/import\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This is a direct result of test execution failure, not a coverage measurement issue.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n- `health_check.py` modifications likely introduced breaking changes\n- Possible syntax errors, import issues, or runtime exceptions\n- Environment/dependency mismatches (missing imports, version conflicts)\n- Test configuration broken by recent changes\n\n## Recommendations\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. **Fix test execution first** - Run tests with verbose output to identify the root cause\n2. **Check `health_check.py` syntax** - Validate Python syntax and imports\n3. **Verify test configuration** - Ensure pytest/unittest configuration is valid\n4. **Review dependency changes** - Check requirements.txt and environment setup\n\n**Follow-up:**\n5. Once tests execute, establish baseline coverage\n6. Add specific tests for `health_check.py` functionality\n7. Implement CI pipeline to catch similar issues earlier\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Codebase is completely untested and potentially broken. Deployment would be extremely risky without:\n- ✅ Passing test suite\n- ✅ Measured code coverage\n- ✅ Validation of `health_check.py` functionality\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
