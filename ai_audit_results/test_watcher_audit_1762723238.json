No tests ran successfully, indicating either:\n- Syntax errors in test files\n- Import failures\n- Test framework configuration issues\n- Fatal errors during test setup\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**ZERO COVERAGE** - 0.00% coverage confirms no code was executed. This represents a complete testing breakdown.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **tests/test_circuit_breaker.py** likely contains fatal errors preventing test execution\n2. **health_check.py** changes may have broken imports or dependencies\n3. Possible circular imports between test files and modules\n4. Missing dependencies or environment setup issues\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Fix Test Execution First**:\n   - Run `python -m pytest tests/ -v` to see specific error details\n   - Check for syntax errors in test_circuit_breaker.py\n   - Verify all imports work correctly\n\n2. **Debug Steps**:\n   - Test imports manually: `python -c \"from tests.test_circuit_breaker import *\"`\n   - Check pytest configuration and requirements\n   - Ensure test dependencies are installed\n\n3. **Validation**:\n   - Get at least one test passing before addressing coverage\n   - Add simple smoke tests to verify basic functionality\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deploying without any test validation is extremely dangerous:\n- Circuit breaker functionality is critical for system resilience\n- Zero test coverage means undetected failures are likely in production\n- Health check failures could cause cascading system issues\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
