    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional:\n- Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely unhandled exception or system error)\n- Zero test execution suggests fundamental infrastructure issues\n- No meaningful quality assessment possible until basic test execution is resolved\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**COVERAGE: 0%** - Complete coverage failure:\n- No code was executed during test run\n- Coverage data is empty ({})\n- This indicates tests never reached any application code\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **File modifications likely broke test infrastructure:**\n   - Changes to `full_ai_audit_deepseek_perplexity_deepseek.py` may have introduced fatal errors\n   - `automation\\deepseek_robot\\robot.py` modifications could have broken test automation framework\n2. **Possible root causes:**\n   - Import errors or circular dependencies\n   - Missing dependencies in test environment\n   - Syntax errors preventing test discovery\n   - Configuration changes breaking test runner\n\n## Immediate Action Recommendations\n1. **Debug Test Infrastructure:**\n   - Run tests with `-v` flag to see which test fails first\n   - Check test runner configuration and environment setup\n   - Verify all dependencies are installed and compatible\n\n2. **Isolate the Break:**\n   - Test each changed file independently\n   - Roll back changes one at a time to identify the breaking modification\n   - Check for syntax errors with `python -m py_compile [file]`\n\n3. **Restore Basic Functionality:**\n   - Get any single test passing before addressing coverage\n   - Fix import paths and module structure first\n   - Ensure test discovery is working\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- No reliable quality feedback mechanism\n- Potential production issues undetectable\n- Development effectively flying blind\n- Urgent attention required before further changes\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately - this blocks all meaningful quality assessment and deployment safety.",
