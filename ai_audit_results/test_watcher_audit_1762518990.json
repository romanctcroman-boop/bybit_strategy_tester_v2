No tests ran successfully, indicating either:\n- Syntax errors in test files or code\n- Missing dependencies/environment setup\n- Test framework configuration issues\n- Critical runtime exceptions during test discovery\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - Complete coverage failure. This means:\n- No code was executed during test run\n- All existing tests either failed or didn't run\n- No meaningful coverage data collected\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe file `send_compact_to_deepseek.py` likely contains:\n- Syntax errors preventing import/execution\n- Missing imports or dependencies\n- Runtime errors during module loading\n- Breaking changes to function signatures or class definitions\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n\n**1. Fix Test Execution First:**\n```bash\n# Run with verbose output to see failure details\npython -m pytest -v\n# Check for syntax errors\npython -m py_compile send_compact_to_deepseek.py\n```\n\n**2. Investigate Exit Code -1:**\n- Check test framework configuration\n- Verify all dependencies are installed\n- Examine test discovery process\n\n**3. Validate the Changed File:**\n- Manually import and test `send_compact_to_deepseek.py`\n- Check for circular imports or initialization issues\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- No reliable test feedback\n- Potential production-breaking code\n- Complete lack of quality assurance\n- High probability of undetected regressions\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
