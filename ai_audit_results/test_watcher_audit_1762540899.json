    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates a fatal error preventing test execution entirely. This represents a complete breakdown in testing infrastructure.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% coverage** - No code is being tested. This means:\n- All production code is completely unverified\n- No regression detection capability\n- Zero confidence in code changes\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe stress test files (`test_memory_leaks.py`, `test_parallel_execution.py`) likely contain:\n- Fatal syntax errors or import failures\n- Infinite loops or resource exhaustion\n- Environment configuration issues\n- Missing dependencies for stress testing\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Fix Test Execution First**\n   - Run tests individually to identify which file causes the crash\n   - Check for syntax errors: `python -m py_compile tests/stress/test_*.py`\n   - Verify imports and dependencies\n\n2. **Temporary Mitigation**\n   - Comment out stress tests to restore basic test functionality\n   - Add try-catch blocks in stress tests to prevent total failure\n\n3. **Infrastructure Improvements**\n   - Add test isolation to prevent one failing test from breaking entire suite\n   - Implement staged testing (unit → integration → stress)\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Shipping code in this state is extremely dangerous:\n- Undetected bugs guaranteed in production\n- No safety net for recent changes\n- Memory leaks and performance issues could go unnoticed\n- Parallel execution problems may cause production outages\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development.",
