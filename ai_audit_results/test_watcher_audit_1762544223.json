This indicates fundamental issues with the test environment, dependencies, or test code structure that prevent any tests from running.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **Total Coverage: 0.00%** - No code was executed during testing\n- **No coverage data available** - Tests didn't reach execution phase\n- **Critical gap**: Entire test suite is non-functional\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Test file `test_health_endpoints.py` likely contains syntax errors** or import failures\n2. **Missing dependencies** - Required packages not installed or incompatible versions\n3. **Environment configuration issues** - Path problems, missing environment variables\n4. **Test framework setup errors** - pytest/unittest configuration problems\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. Run `python -m py_compile tests/monitoring/test_health_endpoints.py` to check for syntax errors\n2. Verify test dependencies: `pip list` and compare with requirements\n3. Execute tests with `pytest -xvs tests/monitoring/test_health_endpoints.py` for detailed error output\n4. Check test discovery configuration in `pytest.ini`/`setup.cfg`\n\n**Follow-up:**\n- Add pre-commit hooks to validate test syntax\n- Implement CI pipeline that fails fast on test compilation errors\n- Create smoke tests to verify test environment health\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- No regression testing capability\n- Potential production issues undetectable\n- Development blocked until resolved\n- High likelihood of undetected bugs in health monitoring endpoints\n\n**Priority: Fix immediately** - This blocks all meaningful quality assurance.",
