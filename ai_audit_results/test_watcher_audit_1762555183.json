    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely unhandled exception or environment crash). No tests executed successfully.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0.00% coverage** - No code was executed during testing. This represents maximum risk level.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n- Server.py modifications likely introduced fatal errors preventing test execution\n- Possible syntax errors, import failures, or infinite loops\n- Environment/dependency issues (missing imports, version conflicts)\n- Test harness itself may be broken\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Debug Test Execution**\n   - Run tests with verbose output to identify crash point\n   - Check Python syntax: `python -m py_compile mcp-server/server.py`\n   - Verify dependencies and imports\n\n2. **Isolate the Failure**\n   - Run minimal test case to verify test framework works\n   - Test server.py in isolation with basic import\n   - Check for circular imports or initialization errors\n\n3. **Emergency Fix Priority**\n   - Fix fatal errors blocking test execution first\n   - Add basic smoke tests before addressing coverage\n   - Implement error handling to prevent complete test suite collapse\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**SEVERE RISK** - Code is completely untested and potentially non-functional. Deployment would be extremely risky. The -1 exit code suggests the application may not even start.\n\n**Immediate Action Required**: Fix test execution before any further development or deployment.",
