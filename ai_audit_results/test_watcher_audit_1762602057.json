    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1). No meaningful test quality can be assessed since tests didn't run successfully. This indicates either fatal test infrastructure issues or severe code defects preventing test execution.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**ZERO COVERAGE** - 0.00% coverage confirms no tests executed successfully. All code paths are untested, creating maximum testing debt.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe single changed file `full_ai_audit_deepseek_perplexity_deepseek.py` likely contains:\n- **Syntax errors** preventing import/execution\n- **Missing dependencies** causing import failures\n- **Runtime exceptions** during test setup\n- **Infinite loops** or **memory issues** crashing test runner\n- **Configuration errors** in test environment\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. **Debug test failure** - Check test runner logs for specific error messages\n2. **Validate file syntax** - Run `python -m py_compile full_ai_audit_deepseek_perplexity_deepseek.py`\n3. **Test isolation** - Run tests for this file individually to identify the breaking change\n4. **Add basic smoke test** - Create minimal test that imports and instantiates main classes\n\n**FOLLOW-UP:**\n5. **Implement test pyramid** - Start with unit tests before integration tests\n6. **Add CI pipeline validation** - Prevent merging code that breaks test execution\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- **Production readiness: UNACCEPTABLE** - No verification of functionality\n- **Regression risk: EXTREME** - Any change could break existing behavior\n- **Deployment risk: PROHIBITED** - Should not deploy until basic tests pass\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development.",
