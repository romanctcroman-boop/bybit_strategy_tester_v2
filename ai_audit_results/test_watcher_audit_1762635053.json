    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely segmentation fault, environment crash, or fatal Python error). No tests executed successfully.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% coverage** - No code was executed during testing. This represents maximum risk - we have zero visibility into whether any functionality works.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe changed files suggest:\n1. **Health check integration issues** - `health_check.py` modifications may have introduced fatal dependencies or import cycles\n2. **Server initialization failures** - `mcp-server/server.py` changes likely broke core server startup\n3. **Environment/dependency conflicts** - Possible version mismatches or missing requirements\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. Run tests with `-v` flag to see which test fails first\n2. Check server logs for segmentation faults or import errors\n3. Verify all dependencies are installed and compatible\n4. Test server startup independently: `python mcp-server/server.py`\n\n**Systematic Fixes:**\n1. Add basic smoke test before full test suite\n2. Implement health check endpoint validation\n3. Add dependency version checks in CI pipeline\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Cannot deploy. The system may have:\n- Critical runtime failures\n- Broken API endpoints  \n- Security vulnerabilities (undetected due to no test execution)\n- Integration failures with dependent services\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
