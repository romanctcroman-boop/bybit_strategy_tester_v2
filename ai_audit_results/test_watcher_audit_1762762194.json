    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates a fatal error preventing test execution entirely. This represents a complete testing breakdown.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% coverage across all files** - No code is being tested. The coverage report is empty, suggesting tests aren't even reaching execution phase.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **test_integration_simple.py** likely contains syntax errors, import failures, or configuration issues\n2. **request_next_phase_audit.py** may have breaking changes that prevent test initialization\n3. Possible circular imports or missing dependencies in the test environment\n4. Test runner configuration may be corrupted or misconfigured\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. Run tests with `-v` flag to see specific failure details\n2. Check test file syntax: `python -m py_compile test_integration_simple.py`\n3. Verify imports work in isolation\n4. Examine test configuration and environment setup\n\n**FOLLOW-UP:**\n- Add basic smoke test to verify test framework functionality\n- Implement continuous integration checks to catch similar failures early\n- Review recent commits for breaking changes to test infrastructure\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - No testing feedback means undetected bugs could be deployed to production. The entire test suite is compromised, representing significant quality and deployment risk.\n\n**Priority:** Resolve immediately before any further development or deployment.",
