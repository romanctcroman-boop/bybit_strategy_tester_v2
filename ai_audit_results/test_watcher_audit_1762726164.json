    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely unhandled exception or environment crash). Zero coverage confirms no tests executed successfully.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **100% coverage gap** - No code executed during testing\n- All test files failed to run, making coverage data unavailable\n- Critical lack of basic test infrastructure validation\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Environment/Setup Failure**: Recent changes in `simplified_reliable_mcp.py` likely broke import chains or dependencies\n2. **Configuration Break**: Modified files suggest encryption/key management changes that may have disrupted test environment\n3. **Dependency Conflict**: New encryption logic in `test_encrypted_keys.py` may require missing dependencies\n4. **Import/Circular Dependencies**: Changes likely created import failures preventing test execution\n\n## Immediate Action Recommendations\n1. **Fix Basic Test Execution**:\n   - Run tests individually to identify which file causes the crash\n   - Check for missing imports in `simplified_reliable_mcp.py`\n   - Verify all dependencies are installed\n\n2. **Add Basic Sanity Tests**:\n   - Create simple smoke tests that validate import and basic functionality\n   - Add test environment validation checks\n\n3. **Investigate Encryption Changes**:\n   - Review `test_encrypted_keys.py` for environment requirements\n   - Ensure encryption dependencies are available in test environment\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Production deployment would be extremely risky:\n- Zero test validation of recent changes\n- Potential encryption/security functionality completely untested\n- High probability of runtime failures in production\n- No confidence in reliability of modified components\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
