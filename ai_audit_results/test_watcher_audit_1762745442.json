No tests ran successfully, indicating either:\n- Syntax errors in test files or code\n- Missing dependencies/environment setup\n- Test framework configuration issues\n- Fatal errors during test discovery/import\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This is a direct result of test execution failure, not a coverage measurement issue.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n- **health_check.py** likely contains breaking changes causing test infrastructure failure\n- Possible import errors, syntax errors, or circular dependencies introduced\n- Environment/dependency mismatches between development and test environments\n\n## Recommendations\n1. **Immediate Action:**\n   - Run tests with verbose output to identify the specific failure point\n   - Check `health_check.py` for syntax errors: `python -m py_compile health_check.py`\n   - Verify imports and dependencies in test environment\n\n2. **Debugging Steps:**\n   - Run a single simple test to isolate the issue\n   - Check test runner configuration and environment variables\n   - Ensure all required packages are installed in test environment\n\n3. **Process Improvements:**\n   - Add pre-commit hooks to catch syntax errors\n   - Implement CI pipeline that fails fast on import/syntax issues\n   - Add basic smoke tests that run before full test suite\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - The codebase is currently untestable. Any bugs in `health_check.py` could go undetected, potentially causing production failures. Deployment should be blocked until tests can execute successfully.\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
