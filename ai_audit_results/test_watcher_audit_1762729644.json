No tests ran successfully, indicating either fatal runtime errors or test environment issues.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This represents a complete testing failure rather than a coverage gap.\n\n## Potential Issues\n1. **Test File Syntax/Runtime Errors** - `test_critical_fixes.py` likely contains fatal Python errors\n2. **Missing Dependencies** - Required imports or test fixtures may be unavailable\n3. **Environment Configuration** - Test runner or environment may be misconfigured\n4. **Infinite Loops/Crashes** - Tests may be hanging or crashing the runner\n\n## Immediate Actions Required\n1. **Run tests locally** to see the actual error message\n2. **Check test file syntax** with `python -m py_compile test_critical_fixes.py`\n3. **Verify imports and dependencies** are available in test environment\n4. **Run with verbose output** to capture specific failure details\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - No validation of recent changes. Production code is completely untested and may contain critical defects.\n\n## Priority Recommendations\n1. **Fix test execution first** - Address the Exit Code -1 before analyzing coverage\n2. **Add basic smoke tests** to verify test infrastructure works\n3. **Implement CI/CD failure alerts** for immediate notification of test crashes\n4. **Review recent changes** to `test_critical_fixes.py` for obvious syntax/import issues\n\n**Next Step**: The absolute priority is getting tests to run at all. Coverage analysis is irrelevant until Exit Code becomes 0.",
