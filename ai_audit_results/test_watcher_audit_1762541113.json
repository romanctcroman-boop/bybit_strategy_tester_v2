The test suite is non-functional and provides zero quality assurance.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% coverage** - Complete test infrastructure failure. No code was executed, making coverage metrics meaningless until basic test stability is restored.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n- **test_crash.py** is the culprit - likely contains syntax errors, import failures, or infinite loops\n- Possible causes: missing dependencies, environment configuration issues, or fatal runtime errors\n- Test framework may be improperly configured or corrupted\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n1. **Immediate**: Run `test_crash.py` in isolation with debug output to identify crash cause\n2. **Fix root cause**: Address syntax errors, import issues, or environmental dependencies\n3. **Add validation**: Implement pre-commit hooks to catch syntax errors before test execution\n4. **Restore baseline**: Ensure at least one passing test exists before expanding coverage\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - No functional testing means undetected bugs could reach production. Development is effectively flying blind until test stability is restored.\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
