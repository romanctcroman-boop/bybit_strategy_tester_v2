Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely uncaught exception during test setup/execution). Zero coverage confirms no tests executed successfully.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **0% coverage** across all files\n- No tests executed for modified files (`secure_logger.py`, `schemas.py`)\n- Entire test suite is failing to run\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Breaking changes in dependencies** - Modified schema files may have introduced incompatible changes\n2. **Import/circular dependency issues** - Changes in `schemas.py` could break imports\n3. **Logger initialization failures** - `secure_logger.py` changes may cause crashes during test setup\n4. **Environment/config issues** - Missing dependencies or configuration\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Fix test execution first**:\n   - Run tests with `-v` flag to see specific failure point\n   - Check for unhandled exceptions in test configuration/setup\n   - Verify all dependencies are installed and compatible\n\n2. **Debug specific files**:\n   - Test `secure_logger.py` imports and initialization in isolation\n   - Validate `schemas.py` for syntax errors and import cycles\n   - Check for missing environment variables or config files\n\n3. **Restore basic functionality**:\n   - Get any single test passing before addressing coverage\n   - Add simple smoke tests for core functionality\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deployment would be extremely dangerous:\n- Zero test validation means any code changes could introduce critical bugs\n- Security implications from `secure_logger` modifications are completely untested\n- API schema changes could break client integrations\n- **Recommend blocking all deployments until basic test execution is restored**\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution infrastructure immediately, then add minimal test coverage for security and API components.",
