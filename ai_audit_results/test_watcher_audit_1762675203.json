    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely uncaught exception during test setup/execution). Zero coverage suggests tests never executed properly.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**100% GAP** - No code coverage achieved. Critical files modified have zero test validation:\n- Rate limiting logic (`rate_limiter.py` files)\n- Exchange adapter (`bybit.py`) \n- Core metrics (`metrics.py`)\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Breaking changes** in modified files preventing test execution\n2. **Missing dependencies** or configuration in test environment\n3. **Syntax errors** or import issues in changed modules\n4. **Test infrastructure failure** (fixtures, setup, environment)\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. Run tests with `-v` flag to see specific failure point\n2. Check test logs for uncaught exceptions\n3. Verify all imports in changed files resolve correctly\n4. Test each modified file in isolation to identify breaking changes\n\n**FOLLOW-UP:**\n5. Add basic smoke tests for each modified component\n6. Fix test infrastructure before addressing coverage\n7. Implement health checks for critical paths (rate limiting, exchange connectivity)\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deploying these changes would be extremely dangerous:\n- Core security (rate limiting) and financial (exchange adapter) components untested\n- No validation of modified business logic\n- Potential production outages or security vulnerabilities\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
