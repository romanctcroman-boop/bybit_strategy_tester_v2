    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely unhandled exception or environment crash). No tests executed successfully.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This represents complete test infrastructure failure rather than coverage gaps.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **send_final_reports_to_deepseek.py** likely contains:\n   - Syntax errors preventing import/execution\n   - Missing dependencies or imports\n   - Runtime errors during test discovery\n   - Environment configuration issues\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Debug Test Infrastructure**\n   - Run tests with `-v` flag to see specific failure point\n   - Check Python syntax: `python -m py_compile send_final_reports_to_deepseek.py`\n   - Verify dependencies and imports\n\n2. **Isolate the Failure**\n   - Test the file directly: `python send_final_reports_to_deepseek.py`\n   - Run minimal test case to verify basic functionality\n\n3. **Add Basic Validation**\n   - Implement try/catch blocks around main functionality\n   - Add basic unit tests for core functions\n   - Verify environment variables and configurations\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Production deployment would be extremely risky:\n- Zero test validation of core functionality\n- Unknown runtime behavior\n- Potential for complete system failure\n- No regression protection\n\n**Priority**: Fix test infrastructure immediately before any further development or deployment.",
