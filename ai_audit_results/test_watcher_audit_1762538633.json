This indicates either catastrophic test infrastructure issues or severe code defects preventing test execution.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **Total Coverage: 0.00%** - No code was executed during testing\n- **No coverage data available** - Test runner failed before collecting any metrics\n- **Critical gap**: Unable to assess actual code coverage due to execution failure\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Security enhancements tests (`test_security_enhancements.py`) likely contain fatal errors**\n2. **Possible causes**:\n   - Syntax errors in test file\n   - Missing dependencies/imports\n   - Infinite loops or memory issues\n   - Test framework configuration problems\n   - Critical exceptions in setup/teardown\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. **Debug test execution**:\n   ```bash\n   python -m pytest tests/test_security_enhancements.py -v\n   ```\n2. **Check for syntax errors**:\n   ```bash\n   python -m py_compile tests/test_security_enhancements.py\n   ```\n3. **Run with detailed output** to identify failure point\n4. **Review recent changes** to the test file for obvious errors\n\n**FOLLOW-UP:**\n- Add test validation in CI pipeline to catch similar issues earlier\n- Implement test isolation to prevent single test failure from blocking entire suite\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state provides zero confidence in code quality or security enhancements:\n- No validation of security implementations\n- Potential undiscovered vulnerabilities\n- Deployment would be extremely risky\n- Entire test suite is effectively disabled\n\n**Priority: Fix immediately before any further development or deployment.**",
