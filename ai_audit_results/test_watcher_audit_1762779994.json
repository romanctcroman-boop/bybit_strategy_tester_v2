    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution is completely broken:\n- Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely unhandled exception or system error)\n- Zero tests executed successfully\n- No coverage data collected\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**NO COVERAGE DATA** - This is worse than low coverage:\n- Coverage system failed to initialize or execute\n- Cannot assess actual code coverage gaps\n- Indicates fundamental infrastructure issues\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n**HIGH SUSPICION ON MODIFIED FILES:**\n1. `tests\\unit\\test_batch_writer.py` - Likely contains syntax errors, import failures, or destructive code\n2. `tests\\backend\\conftest.py` - Fixture/config errors may be breaking entire test suite\n3. Possible circular imports, missing dependencies, or environment configuration issues\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n**PRIORITY 1 - RESTORE TEST EXECUTION:**\n1. **Isolate the failure**: Run each test file individually to identify which one crashes\n2. **Check `conftest.py` first** - Fixture errors often break entire test suites\n3. **Validate imports and dependencies** - Ensure all modules and packages are available\n4. **Add try-catch blocks** around test setup to capture and log fatal errors\n\n**PRIORITY 2 - PREVENT RECURRENCE:**\n1. Implement pre-commit hooks that validate test syntax\n2. Add basic smoke tests that run before full test suite\n3. Set up CI pipeline to fail fast on test infrastructure issues\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- No reliable quality gate for code changes\n- Potential undetected regressions in production code\n- Development workflow is blocked for all team members\n- Urgent fix required before any further deployments\n\n**ACTION:** Immediately revert the problematic changes and investigate in isolation before attempting to fix in main branch.",
