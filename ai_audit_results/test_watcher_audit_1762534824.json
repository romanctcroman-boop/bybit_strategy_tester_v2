    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely unhandled exception or environment crash). Zero coverage confirms no tests executed successfully.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **100% coverage gap** - No code executed during testing\n- No coverage data available for any files, including modified ones\n- Test infrastructure itself appears broken\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **health_check.py** modifications may have introduced fatal errors\n2. **automation\\task3_audit_agent\\config.py** changes could be causing import/config failures\n3. Possible circular imports or missing dependencies from recent changes\n4. Environment configuration broken (paths, dependencies, setup)\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Fix test execution first** - Run tests with `-v` flag to see specific failure point\n2. Check for syntax errors in modified files: `python -m py_compile health_check.py`\n3. Verify imports and dependencies in both changed files\n4. Add basic exception handling to identify crash location\n5. Run tests on individual files to isolate the breaking change\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deployment would be blind with zero test validation. Recent changes likely introduced breaking changes that prevent even basic test execution. Code quality cannot be assessed without functioning tests.\n\n**Priority #1**: Restore test execution capability before any further development.",
