    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely unhandled exception during test setup/execution). Zero coverage suggests tests never executed properly.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **100% coverage gap** - No code was executed during testing\n- All modified files show 0% coverage, indicating fundamental test infrastructure issues\n- No baseline comparison available due to complete test failure\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Test environment broken** - Likely import errors, missing dependencies, or configuration issues\n2. **Recent file changes may have introduced breaking changes** to test runners or imports\n3. **Possible circular imports** between the three modified files\n4. **Test discovery failure** - pytest/unitest cannot locate or load tests\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Fix test execution first**:\n   - Run with `-v` flag to see specific failure points\n   - Check for import errors in `test_reliable_mcp.py`\n   - Verify all dependencies are installed\n\n2. **Debug specific areas**:\n   - Test if individual files can be imported separately\n   - Check for missing `__init__.py` files in reliability package\n   - Validate recent changes didn't break module structure\n\n3. **Add basic smoke tests**:\n   - Create minimal test that imports each changed file\n   - Verify basic functionality before comprehensive testing\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deploying these changes is extremely dangerous:\n- Zero validation of reliability module changes\n- Potential runtime errors undetected\n- Critical path code (reliability) completely untested\n- **Recommendation**: Block deployment until basic test execution is restored and >80% coverage achieved",
