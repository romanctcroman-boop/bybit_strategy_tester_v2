Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely unhandled exception in test framework or environment).\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - No tests executed successfully. All code changes are completely untested.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Circuit breaker implementation likely broken** - Changes in `reliability/circuit_breaker.py` may have introduced syntax errors, import issues, or runtime exceptions\n2. **Test infrastructure failure** - Possible issues with test configuration, dependencies, or environment setup\n3. **Breaking API changes** - Modified interfaces without updating tests\n\n## Immediate Actions Required\n1. **Fix test execution first** - Run tests with verbose output to identify the root cause of exit code -1\n2. **Check for syntax errors** in circuit_breaker.py\n3. **Verify imports and dependencies** - Ensure all required packages are installed\n4. **Run isolated test** on circuit_breaker.py to confirm basic functionality\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deploying these changes would be extremely dangerous:\n- Zero test validation of reliability-critical circuit breaker logic\n- Potential production outages if circuit breaker fails\n- No safety net for future changes\n\n## Priority Recommendations\n1. **Immediate**: Fix test execution environment - this is blocking all quality checks\n2. **High**: Add basic unit tests for circuit breaker states (closed, open, half-open)\n3. **Medium**: Achieve 80%+ coverage on circuit breaker before deployment\n4. **Continuous**: Implement pre-commit hooks to prevent 0% coverage commits\n\n**Start by diagnosing why tests won't run at all - this is the most urgent issue.**",
