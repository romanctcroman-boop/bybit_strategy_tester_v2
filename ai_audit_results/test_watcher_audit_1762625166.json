    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely uncaught exception during test setup/execution).\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% coverage** - No tests are executing successfully. This represents maximum coverage gap - all code is untested.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n- Server.py modifications likely introduced fatal errors preventing test execution\n- Possible syntax errors, import failures, or runtime exceptions in test harness\n- Test infrastructure may be broken (fixtures, configuration, dependencies)\n\n## Recommendations\n**Immediate (Priority 1):**\n1. Run tests with `-v` flag to see which specific test is failing\n2. Check test logs for stack traces and error messages\n3. Verify test dependencies and environment setup\n4. Test server.py in isolation to identify syntax/runtime issues\n\n**Short-term:**\n1. Fix the root cause preventing test execution\n2. Add basic smoke tests to prevent complete test suite collapse\n3. Implement test failure alerts with detailed error reporting\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Code changes cannot be validated. Deployment carries significant risk of production failures. All recent changes to server.py are effectively untested.",
