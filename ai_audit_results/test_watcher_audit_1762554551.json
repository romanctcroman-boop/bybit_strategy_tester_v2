This indicates either:\n- Syntax errors in test files or application code\n- Missing dependencies or environment configuration issues\n- Test framework configuration problems\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% coverage** - All tests failed before any code execution could be measured. No coverage data was collected.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe failure likely relates to changes in `backend\\api\\app.py`:\n- Syntax errors introduced in the modified file\n- Breaking changes to imports or dependencies\n- Configuration changes that broke test initialization\n\n## Recommendations\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. Run tests with verbose output to identify the specific failure point\n2. Check `backend\\api\\app.py` for syntax errors using `python -m py_compile`\n3. Verify all imports and dependencies are correctly installed\n4. Run a minimal test to isolate the issue\n\n**Follow-up:**\n- Fix the root cause preventing test execution\n- Add pre-commit hooks to catch syntax errors\n- Implement basic smoke tests to validate test environment\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - No tests are running, meaning:\n- Undetected bugs may exist in production code\n- Recent changes to `app.py` are completely untested\n- Deployment could introduce critical failures\n- Entire codebase is effectively untested\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
