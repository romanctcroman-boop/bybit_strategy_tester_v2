This represents a complete breakdown in testing infrastructure.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code coverage was collected, indicating:\n- Tests failed before any meaningful execution\n- Potential configuration issues with coverage tools\n- Test environment may not be properly initialized\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe failure coincides with changes to `monitoring\\test_alerts.py`, suggesting:\n- Syntax errors in test file\n- Missing imports or dependencies\n- Test setup/teardown failures\n- Configuration changes breaking test execution\n- Circular imports or module loading issues\n\n## Immediate Action Recommendations\n1. **Debug Test Execution**\n   - Run `python -m pytest monitoring/test_alerts.py -v` to see specific error\n   - Check for Python syntax errors in the test file\n   - Verify all imports are valid and available\n\n2. **Fix Basic Test Infrastructure**\n   - Ensure pytest is properly installed and configured\n   - Check for missing test dependencies\n   - Validate test environment setup\n\n3. **Restore Baseline Functionality**\n   - Revert `test_alerts.py` changes if recently modified\n   - Run minimal smoke test to confirm basic functionality\n   - Re-establish code coverage collection\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- No reliable testing feedback loop\n- Potential for undetected regressions\n- Deployment risks significantly increased\n- Code quality cannot be measured or assured\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
