    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution crashed (Exit Code -1) before any tests could run. This indicates severe infrastructure or environmental issues, not test logic problems.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% coverage** - No code was executed due to test harness failure. This is a system-level issue, not a coverage gap.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **test_critical_fixes.py** likely contains syntax errors or import failures\n2. Possible missing dependencies or environment configuration issues\n3. Test runner configuration may be broken\n4. File could be corrupted or contain invalid Python syntax\n\n## Recommendations\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. Check test file syntax: `python -m py_compile test_critical_fixes.py`\n2. Verify imports and dependencies in the test file\n3. Run tests with verbose output to see exact failure point\n4. Test basic Python execution in the environment\n\n**Follow-up:**\n1. Add pre-commit hooks to validate syntax\n2. Implement CI pipeline that catches environment issues earlier\n3. Create smoke tests for test infrastructure\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Complete test failure means:\n- No validation of recent changes\n- Potential undiscovered bugs in production\n- Broken deployment pipeline\n- All code changes are effectively untested\n\n**Priority:** Fix test infrastructure immediately before any further development.",
