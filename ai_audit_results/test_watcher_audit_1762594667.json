No tests ran successfully, indicating either:\n- Syntax errors in test files or code\n- Missing dependencies\n- Configuration issues\n- Test harness failures\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0.00% coverage** - No code was executed during testing. This is a complete testing failure, not just low coverage.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe changed file `backend\\api\\deepseek_pool.py` likely contains:\n- Syntax errors preventing import/execution\n- Missing imports or dependencies\n- Runtime errors during module loading\n- Circular imports or initialization issues\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. Run `python -m py_compile backend\\api\\deepseek_pool.py` to check for syntax errors\n2. Verify all imports and dependencies are available\n3. Check test configuration and environment setup\n4. Run tests with `-v` flag to see specific failure details\n\n**Follow-up:**\n- Fix the root cause preventing test execution\n- Ensure tests run successfully before assessing coverage\n- Add basic smoke tests to verify module importability\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deploying untested code. Without any test execution:\n- Critical bugs may exist in production\n- No validation of recent changes\n- Complete lack of quality assurance\n- High probability of runtime failures\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
