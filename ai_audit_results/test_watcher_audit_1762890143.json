    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely unhandled exception or environment crash). No tests executed successfully.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% coverage** - No code was executed during testing. This represents maximum coverage gap - the entire codebase is untested.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe CLI script (`cli_send_to_deepseek.py`) likely contains:\n- Fatal syntax errors preventing import/execution\n- Missing dependencies or imports\n- Environment configuration issues\n- Infinite loops or crashes during test setup\n- Test runner configuration problems\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. Run tests with `-v` flag to see exact failure point\n2. Check Python syntax: `python -m py_compile cli_send_to_deepseek.py`\n3. Verify all imports and dependencies are available\n4. Add basic exception handling to prevent test runner crashes\n\n**Short-term:**\n1. Create minimal smoke test that imports the module\n2. Add basic unit tests for core functions\n3. Set up test environment with proper dependency isolation\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Code is completely untested and potentially unstable. Deployment would be extremely risky. Critical bugs could go undetected until production failure.\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
