Run tests with `-v` flag to see specific failure details\n2. Check test environment setup and dependencies\n3. Validate `test_e2e_test_watcher_v2.py` for syntax errors\n4. Ensure all required services are running for integration tests\n\n**FOLLOW-UP:**\n5. Add basic unit tests alongside integration tests\n6. Implement test environment health checks\n7. Set up continuous integration with proper error reporting\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - No test validation means:\n- Undetected regressions likely in production\n- Code changes cannot be safely deployed\n- Critical bugs may go unnoticed\n- Integration points are completely unverified\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development.",
