Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely segmentation fault, memory issues, or environment problems).\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% coverage** across all files - No tests are executing successfully. This represents maximum risk level.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Environment/Infrastructure**: Recent changes in `send_compact_to_deepseek.py` or `send_to_deepseek_full_analysis.py` may have introduced:\n   - Memory leaks or segmentation faults\n   - Missing dependencies or broken imports\n   - Infinite loops or blocking operations\n   - Environment configuration issues\n\n2. **Integration Problems**: Files suggest API/client implementations that may have authentication, network, or resource exhaustion issues.\n\n## Immediate Actions Required\n1. **Debug Exit Code -1**:\n   ```bash\n   python -m pytest -v --tb=short  # Identify failing test\n   python -c \"import send_compact_to_deepseek\"  # Check basic import\n   ```\n\n2. **Isolate the Failure**:\n   - Test each file independently\n   - Check for missing environment variables\n   - Verify API credentials/endpoints aren't causing crashes\n\n3. **Add Basic Sanity Tests**:\n   - Simple import tests\n   - Minimal function unit tests\n   - Mock external dependencies\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Production deployment would be extremely dangerous:\n- No code validation through tests\n- Potential runtime crashes in production\n- Undetected regression bugs\n- Complete lack of quality assurance\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
