Implement test failure alerts with detailed error logging\n6. Add pre-commit hooks to prevent similar breaking changes\n7. Create isolated test environments to avoid dependency conflicts\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**SEVERITY: CRITICAL** 🔴\n- **Deployment Risk**: Cannot verify any functionality - DO NOT DEPLOY\n- **Regression Risk**: All existing functionality is untested\n- **Business Impact**: Complete loss of test confidence, high probability of undetected bugs in production\n\n**Priority**: Fix test infrastructure immediately before any further development or deployment.",
