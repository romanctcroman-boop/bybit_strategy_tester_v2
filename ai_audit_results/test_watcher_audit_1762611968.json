This indicates either catastrophic test infrastructure issues or severe code defects preventing test execution.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0.00% coverage** - Complete test failure. No code was executed, making coverage data meaningless. All code paths are effectively untested.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe failure coincides with changes to `mcp-server\\api\\providers\\perplexity.py`:\n- **Syntax errors** - Likely breaking Python syntax\n- **Import/circular dependency** issues preventing module loading\n- **Missing dependencies** causing import failures\n- **Runtime errors** during test setup/import phase\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Fix test execution first** - Run `python -m py_compile mcp-server/api/providers/perplexity.py` to check for syntax errors\n2. **Verify imports** - Check all imports in the changed file exist and are accessible\n3. **Test isolation** - Run tests on the perplexity.py module in isolation\n4. **Check test configuration** - Ensure pytest/coverage configuration isn't broken\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Production deployment would be extremely dangerous:\n- Zero test validation of recent changes\n- Unknown if basic functionality works\n- High probability of runtime failures in production\n- No safety net for future changes\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
