    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1). No meaningful test quality can be assessed since tests didn't run to completion. This indicates fundamental issues in the test infrastructure or codebase.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0.00% coverage** - No code was executed during testing. This is not a coverage gap issue but a complete test execution failure.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Syntax/Import Errors** in `advanced_architecture.py` likely preventing test execution\n2. **Missing Dependencies** - New imports in the changed file may not be available\n3. **Runtime Configuration** - Environment setup or test configuration broken\n4. **Test Framework Issues** - Pytest/Unittest configuration may be corrupted\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Fix Exit Code -1 First**:\n   - Run `python -m py_compile automation\\deepseek_robot\\advanced_architecture.py` to check syntax\n   - Verify all imports in the changed file resolve correctly\n   - Check test runner configuration and dependencies\n\n2. **Debug Execution**:\n   - Run tests with `-v` flag to see specific failure points\n   - Check for uncaught exceptions in test setup\n   - Verify Python environment and package versions\n\n3. **Restore Baseline**:\n   - Get at least one test passing before addressing coverage\n   - Start with minimal smoke tests on the changed file\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Code changes cannot be validated. Any logic in `advanced_architecture.py` is untested and could contain critical bugs. Deployment would be extremely risky.\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or analysis.",
