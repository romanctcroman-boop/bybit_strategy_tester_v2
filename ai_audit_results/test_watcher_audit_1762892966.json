    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely unhandled exception or environment crash). Zero coverage suggests tests never executed properly.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**TOTAL COVERAGE: 0%** - No code was executed during testing. This represents complete testing failure, not just gaps.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Agent Background Service** (`agent_background_service.py`):\n   - Likely contains unhandled exceptions that crash the test runner\n   - Possible infinite loops or blocking operations\n   - Dependency issues (missing imports/services)\n\n2. **Key Manager** (`key_manager.py`):\n   - May have breaking API changes\n   - Could be causing initialization failures\n   - Potential security/permission issues with key operations\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Debug Test Runner**:\n   ```bash\n   python -m pytest -v --tb=short  # Get minimal traceback\n   python -m pytest -x --pdb       # Debug on first failure\n   ```\n\n2. **Isolate Components**:\n   - Test each changed file independently\n   - Check for missing environment variables/configs\n   - Verify all dependencies are installed\n\n3. **Add Basic Sanity Tests**:\n   - Simple import tests for each module\n   - Minimal initialization tests\n   - Mock external dependencies\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deployment would be blind:\n- No validation of core agent/key management functionality\n- Potential runtime crashes in production\n- Security risks in key handling unverified\n- Regression detection completely disabled\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
