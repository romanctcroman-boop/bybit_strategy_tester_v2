This indicates either catastrophic test infrastructure issues or severe code defects preventing any tests from running.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **Total coverage: 0%** - No code was executed during testing\n- **No coverage data available** - Coverage reporting failed entirely\n- **Critical gap**: Unable to assess actual code coverage due to execution failure\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **File `full_ai_audit_deepseek_perplexity_deepseek.py` likely contains:**\n   - Syntax errors preventing import/execution\n   - Fatal runtime errors during module loading\n   - Missing dependencies or imports\n   - Infinite loops or blocking operations\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. **Debug test execution failure:**\n   - Run tests with verbose output to identify the specific failure point\n   - Check for syntax errors: `python -m py_compile full_ai_audit_deepseek_perplexity_deepseek.py`\n   - Test module import: `python -c \"import full_ai_audit_deepseek_perplexity_deepseek\"`\n\n2. **Fix foundational issues:**\n   - Ensure all imports are available and correct\n   - Add basic error handling and logging\n   - Create minimal working test case\n\n3. **Implement test infrastructure:**\n   - Add basic unit tests that can run independently\n   - Set up test environment validation\n   - Add pre-commit hooks for syntax checking\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- **Deployment risk**: Code cannot be reliably tested\n- **Quality risk**: No verification of functionality\n- **Maintenance risk**: Changes cannot be validated\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution before any further development or deployment.",
