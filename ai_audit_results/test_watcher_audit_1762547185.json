No tests ran successfully, indicating either:\n- Syntax errors in test files or application code\n- Missing dependencies or environment configuration issues\n- Test framework configuration problems\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This is a severe indicator that the test suite is non-functional.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n- `backend\\api\\app.py` modifications likely introduced breaking changes\n- Possible syntax errors, import issues, or runtime exceptions\n- Environment/dependency mismatches preventing test execution\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. **Fix test execution first** - Run tests with verbose output to identify the root cause\n2. **Check application startup** - Ensure `app.py` can run without errors\n3. **Verify dependencies** - Confirm all required packages are installed and compatible\n4. **Test configuration** - Review pytest/unittest configuration files\n\n**Follow-up:**\n5. Once tests run, establish baseline coverage\n6. Add tests for `app.py` core functionality (routes, middleware, error handling)\n7. Implement CI pipeline to catch similar issues earlier\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deploying untested code poses significant production risks:\n- Runtime failures in production environment\n- Undetected regression bugs\n- Potential service downtime\n- Data integrity concerns\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
