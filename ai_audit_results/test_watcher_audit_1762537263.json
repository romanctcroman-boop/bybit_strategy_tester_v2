    "analysis": "Based on the test results, here are the key insights:\n\n## 1. Test Quality Assessment\n**Critical Failure** - Exit code -1 indicates a fatal error during test execution, likely a configuration issue, import error, or environment problem preventing any tests from running.\n\n## 2. Coverage Analysis\n**Complete Failure** - 0.00% coverage means no tests executed successfully. This is a critical issue requiring immediate attention.\n\n## 3. Potential Issues\n- **Configuration/Environment**: Likely missing dependencies, broken imports, or environment setup issues\n- **Recent Changes**: Focus on modified test files and backend modules (LSTM predictor, MTF engine)\n- **Test Infrastructure**: `conftest.py` changes may have broken test discovery/setup\n\n## 4. Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Fix Test Execution First**:\n   - Check test runner configuration\n   - Verify all dependencies are installed\n   - Run individual test files to isolate the failure\n   - Review recent changes to `conftest.py`\n\n2. **Priority Testing Order**:\n   - Start with core components: `test_mtf_engine.py`, `test_database\\test_query_optimization.py`\n   - Then API layers: bot and marketdata tests\n   - Finally ML components: LSTM predictor tests\n\n3. **Quick Wins**:\n   - Run `python -m pytest tests/ -v` to get detailed error output\n   - Check for circular imports in modified backend modules\n   - Verify database connections in test setup\n\n## 5. Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - No test validation means:\n- Recent changes to ML components and core engine are completely untested\n- Potential production-breaking changes in API routes and database optimizations\n- Zero confidence in system stability\n\n**Action**: Stop further deployments until basic test execution is restored and critical path coverage reaches at least 70%.",
