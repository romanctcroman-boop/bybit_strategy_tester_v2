    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1) with zero coverage. This indicates fundamental issues in the test environment, test configuration, or code syntax that prevent any tests from running.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **Total Coverage: 0.00%** - No code was executed during testing\n- **No coverage data available** - Tests didn't reach execution phase\n- **Critical gap**: Entire codebase untested due to execution failure\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Syntax/Import Errors** in `analyze_ide_problems.py` likely preventing module import\n2. **Missing Dependencies** - Required packages not installed or incompatible versions\n3. **Test Configuration Issues** - pytest/runner configuration broken\n4. **Environment Setup Failure** - Virtual environment or path issues\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. Run `python -m py_compile analyze_ide_problems.py` to check for syntax errors\n2. Verify imports and dependencies in the changed file\n3. Check test runner configuration and environment variables\n4. Run tests with `-v` flag to see specific failure details\n\n**Follow-up:**\n1. Fix identified syntax/environment issues\n2. Add basic smoke tests to verify module can be imported\n3. Implement CI pipeline to catch similar issues earlier\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Production deployment would be extremely risky:\n- Zero test coverage means undetected runtime errors are likely\n- Critical failures could occur in production environment\n- Recent changes may have introduced breaking changes\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
