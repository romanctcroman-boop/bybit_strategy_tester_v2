No tests ran successfully, indicating either:\n- Syntax errors in test files\n- Import failures\n- Test framework configuration issues\n- Fatal errors during test discovery/setup\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0.00% COVERAGE** - No code coverage was collected because:\n- Tests never executed\n- No production code was touched\n- Coverage reporting failed entirely\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe single changed file `test_code_agent_quick.py` likely contains:\n- Broken imports or syntax errors\n- Missing dependencies\n- Incorrect test configuration\n- Fatal exceptions in test setup/teardown\n\n## Recommendations\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. **Debug test execution**: Run `python -m pytest test_code_agent_quick.py -v` to see specific error details\n2. **Check syntax**: Validate Python syntax in the test file\n3. **Verify imports**: Ensure all imported modules exist and are accessible\n4. **Examine test fixtures**: Review setUp/tearDown methods for errors\n\n**Follow-up:**\n5. Add basic smoke test to verify test framework works\n6. Implement CI pipeline that fails fast on test execution errors\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - No test feedback means:\n- Unknown if recent changes broke functionality\n- Potential production defects undetected\n- Development blocked until tests are functional\n- All code changes are effectively untested\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development.",
