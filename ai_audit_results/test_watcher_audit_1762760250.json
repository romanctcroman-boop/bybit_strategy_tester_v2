    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1). No meaningful test quality assessment possible as tests didn't run to completion. This indicates either:\n- Syntax errors in test code\n- Critical runtime failures during test setup\n- Missing dependencies or configuration\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This is a direct result of the test execution failure, not an indication of actual coverage gaps.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe failure coincides with changes to `reliability\\distributed_cache.py`:\n- Likely introduced breaking changes that prevent test execution\n- Possible syntax errors or import issues\n- May have broken test infrastructure or dependencies\n\n## Recommendations\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. **Fix test execution first** - Run tests locally to identify the specific failure point\n2. **Check syntax** in both test files and the modified cache module\n3. **Verify imports** and dependencies in the distributed cache implementation\n4. **Run isolated tests** on the changed file to pinpoint the issue\n\n**Follow-up:**\n- Once tests execute, establish baseline coverage\n- Add specific unit tests for distributed cache functionality\n- Implement integration tests for cache distribution scenarios\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deploying this code would be extremely risky:\n- No validation of distributed cache functionality\n- Potential runtime failures in production\n- Possible data consistency issues in cache operations\n- Could break dependent services relying on cache system\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
