No tests ran successfully, indicating either:\n- Syntax errors in test files or code\n- Missing dependencies/environment setup\n- Test framework configuration issues\n- Fatal errors during test discovery/import\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This is a direct result of test execution failure, not a coverage measurement issue.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n- `health_check.py` modifications likely introduced breaking changes\n- Possible syntax errors, import issues, or runtime exceptions\n- Environment/dependency mismatches\n- Test configuration broken by recent changes\n\n## Recommendations\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. **Fix test execution first** - Run tests with verbose output to identify the root cause\n2. **Check `health_check.py` syntax** - Validate Python syntax and imports\n3. **Verify test environment** - Ensure all dependencies are installed and compatible\n4. **Run minimal test** - Create a simple test to verify basic functionality\n\n**Follow-up:**\n5. Once tests execute, implement meaningful test cases for `health_check.py`\n6. Add both unit tests (individual functions) and integration tests\n7. Set coverage target of 80%+ for new code\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deploying untested code poses significant production risks:\n- Runtime failures in health check endpoints\n- Service unavailability due to broken monitoring\n- Cascading failures in dependent systems\n- No safety net for future changes\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any deployment.",
