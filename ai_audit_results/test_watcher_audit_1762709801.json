Exit code -1 indicates a fatal error during test execution, likely preventing any tests from running.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **0% coverage** across all files\n- No test execution occurred due to fatal error\n- Both test files and implementation files affected\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Syntax errors** in test files or implementation\n2. **Missing dependencies** or import failures\n3. **Configuration issues** in test runner or environment\n4. **Critical exceptions** during test setup/import\n5. **Circular imports** between test and implementation files\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. Run tests with `-v` flag to see specific error details\n2. Check Python syntax: `python -m py_compile reliability/deepseek_client.py`\n3. Verify imports work in isolation\n4. Examine test runner configuration\n\n**Debugging Steps:**\n- Run individual test files separately\n- Check for missing `__init__.py` files in packages\n- Validate all required dependencies are installed\n- Review recent changes to both modified files\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Production code changes cannot be validated\n- No safety net for recent modifications\n- Potential undetected regressions\n- Deployment would be extremely risky\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
