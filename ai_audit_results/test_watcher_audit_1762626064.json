    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional:\n- Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely unhandled exception or environment issue)\n- Zero test execution suggests fundamental problems in test setup or code structure\n- No coverage data generated implies tests never ran successfully\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**COMPLETE COVERAGE FAILURE:**\n- 0% coverage across all files indicates no code was executed\n- All business logic, error handling, and integration points are untested\n- Critical gap: Entire codebase is effectively unvalidated\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **mcp-server/server.py changes** likely introduced breaking changes\n2. **deepseek_self_integration_check.py** may have dependency or import issues\n3. **test_deepseek_self_check.py** possibly contains syntax errors or missing dependencies\n4. Environment configuration mismatch or missing requirements\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Debug Test Execution:**\n   - Run tests with `-v` flag to see specific failure points\n   - Check Python environment and dependencies\n   - Verify imports in test files\n\n2. **Fix Foundation First:**\n   - Ensure basic test setup/teardown works\n   - Add simple smoke test to verify test framework\n   - Check for circular imports or missing modules\n\n3. **Priority Actions:**\n   - Fix exit code -1 before addressing coverage\n   - Add error handling in test fixtures\n   - Verify MCP server dependencies are installed\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- Production deployments are flying blind\n- Recent changes could have broken core functionality\n- No safety net for regression detection\n- High probability of undetected bugs in production\n\n**Start with making tests executable, then build coverage systematically.**",
