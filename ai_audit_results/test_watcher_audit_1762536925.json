This represents a complete breakdown in testing infrastructure.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code is being tested. All test scenarios are failing to execute, making coverage metrics meaningless until basic test execution is restored.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n- **tests\\test_safe_async_bridge_final.py** appears to be the culprit\n- Likely causes:\n  - Syntax errors in test file\n  - Missing dependencies/imports\n  - Test configuration issues\n  - Fixture/setup failures preventing test discovery\n  - Environment compatibility problems\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. **Debug test execution failure** - Run tests with verbose output (`pytest -v`) to identify the root cause\n2. **Check test file syntax** - Validate Python syntax in the modified test file\n3. **Verify imports and dependencies** - Ensure all required modules are available\n4. **Test isolation** - Run the problematic test file in isolation to confirm it's the source\n\n**FOLLOW-UP:**\n- Implement test failure alerts for early detection\n- Add pre-commit test validation\n- Consider adding a basic smoke test that always passes to catch infrastructure issues\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Shipping untested code poses significant business risk:\n- Production failures likely\n- Regression detection impossible\n- Code quality cannot be measured\n- Deployment confidence: ZERO\n\n**Priority: CRITICAL** - Fix test execution before any further development or deployment.",
