This represents a complete testing breakdown.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **0% coverage** across all files\n- No tests executed successfully\n- Missing: Unit tests, integration tests, functional tests\n- Complete absence of test infrastructure\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **ask_deepseek_about_deadlock.py** and **ask_deepseek_direct.py** likely contain:\n   - Syntax errors preventing import/execution\n   - Missing dependencies or imports\n   - Runtime errors during test discovery\n   - Configuration issues in test setup\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Fix Test Execution First:**\n   - Run `python -m pytest --collect-only` to diagnose discovery issues\n   - Check for syntax errors in test files or modules\n   - Verify Python environment and dependencies\n\n2. **Establish Baseline Testing:**\n   - Create simple smoke tests for each module\n   - Add basic unit tests covering core functionality\n   - Set up CI pipeline with test execution validation\n\n3. **Coverage Foundation:**\n   - Aim for 70%+ coverage once tests execute\n   - Focus on critical paths in both changed files\n   - Add integration tests for API interactions\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- Code changes are completely untested\n- High probability of undetected regressions\n- Production deployment would be extremely risky\n- Potential for runtime failures in modified modules\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
