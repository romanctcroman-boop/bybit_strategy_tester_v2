    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1) with 0% coverage. This indicates either catastrophic test infrastructure issues or severe code defects preventing any tests from running.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **Total coverage: 0%** - No code was executed during testing\n- **No coverage data available** - Test framework failed before collecting metrics\n- **Critical gap**: Unable to assess actual code coverage due to test execution failure\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Syntax/runtime errors** in `robot.py` preventing import/execution\n2. **Missing dependencies** or broken imports in the changed file\n3. **Test infrastructure configuration** issues\n4. **Environment setup** failures (missing packages, path issues)\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. **Fix test execution first** - Run tests locally to identify the root cause\n2. **Check `robot.py` for syntax errors** - Validate the file can be imported\n3. **Verify test dependencies** - Ensure all required packages are installed\n4. **Run minimal test** - Create a simple test to verify basic functionality\n\n**Follow-up:**\n5. Once tests execute, establish baseline coverage\n6. Add unit tests for core `robot.py` functionality\n7. Implement CI pipeline to catch failures earlier\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - The codebase is currently untested and potentially unstable. Shipping this code carries significant risk of:\n- Runtime failures in production\n- Undetected bugs and regressions\n- Broken functionality in dependent systems\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
