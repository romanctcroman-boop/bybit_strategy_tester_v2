    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1). The test suite is non-functional and provides zero quality assurance. This represents a complete breakdown in testing infrastructure.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code is being tested. All test execution is failing before coverage measurement can occur. This indicates either:\n- Test infrastructure configuration errors\n- Fatal exceptions in test setup/teardown\n- Missing dependencies or environment issues\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe changed file `tests/test_service_monitor.py` is likely the root cause:\n- **Syntax errors** in test code\n- **Missing imports** or dependencies\n- **Infinite loops** or blocking operations\n- **Environment configuration** mismatches\n- **Test fixture failures** preventing execution\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n\n**URGENT ACTIONS (Next 30 minutes):**\n1. Run tests with `-v` flag to see which specific test fails\n2. Check test logs for stack traces and error messages\n3. Verify `test_service_monitor.py` for syntax errors\n4. Ensure all test dependencies are installed\n\n**SHORT-TERM FIXES (Today):**\n1. Isolate the failing test using `pytest -k` to run other tests\n2. Add proper exception handling in test setup\n3. Implement test environment validation\n4. Create a basic smoke test to verify test infrastructure\n\n**PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS:**\n1. Add pre-commit hooks to validate test syntax\n2. Implement CI pipeline that fails fast on test infrastructure issues\n3. Add test health monitoring\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state means:\n- No regression detection\n- Undetected production bugs likely\n- Deployment carries significant business risk\n- Code changes are essentially untested\n\n**Priority: CRITICAL** - Fix test execution before any further development or deployments.",
