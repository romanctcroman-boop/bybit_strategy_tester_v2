    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely test harness crash or environment issues). No tests executed successfully.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% coverage** - No code was executed during testing. This represents complete testing failure, not just poor coverage.\n\n## Potential Issues\n1. **Test runner crash** - Possible causes:\n   - Syntax errors in test files\n   - Missing dependencies/imports\n   - Environment configuration issues\n   - Circular imports in `deepseek_self_analysis.py`\n\n2. **File changes impact** - Recent modifications to `deepseek_self_analysis.py` may have:\n   - Introduced fatal syntax errors\n   - Broken module imports\n   - Created circular dependencies\n\n## Immediate Actions Required\n1. **Check test execution logs** - Identify why tests crash immediately\n2. **Validate `deepseek_self_analysis.py` syntax** - Run `python -m py_compile deepseek_self_analysis.py`\n3. **Test import chain** - Try importing the module directly\n4. **Review recent changes** - Check git diff for obvious syntax/import issues\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - No testing feedback means code quality is completely unknown. Deployment would be extremely risky.\n\n## Priority Recommendations\n1. **Fix test execution first** - Don't worry about coverage until tests actually run\n2. **Add basic smoke test** - Ensure test framework loads successfully\n3. **Verify environment** - Check Python version, dependencies, and paths\n4. **Implement CI/CD guardrails** - Prevent merging when tests don't execute\n\n**Next step**: Run tests with verbose output (`-v` flag) to identify where the crash occurs.",
