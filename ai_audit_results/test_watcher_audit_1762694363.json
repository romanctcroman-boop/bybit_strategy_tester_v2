    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test suite failed to execute (Exit Code -1). No meaningful quality assessment possible as tests didn't run. This indicates severe infrastructure or configuration issues.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0.00% coverage** - No code was executed during testing. This is not a coverage gap but a complete test execution failure.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Syntax errors** in `backend\\api\\routers\\backtests.py` likely preventing test execution\n2. **Missing dependencies** or imports in the changed file\n3. **Configuration issues** in test runner or environment setup\n4. **Circular imports** or module loading failures\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Fix syntax errors first** - Run `python -m py_compile backend\\api\\routers\\backtests.py` to identify syntax issues\n2. **Check imports** - Verify all imports in the changed file resolve correctly\n3. **Run tests locally** with `python -m pytest -xvs` to get detailed failure information\n4. **Validate test configuration** - Check pytest.ini, conftest.py, and environment variables\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deploying without functioning tests poses extreme risk. The application may have:\n- Runtime errors preventing startup\n- Broken API endpoints\n- Data integrity issues\n- Security vulnerabilities\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
