The test suite failed to execute properly.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0.00% coverage is a major red flag** - This suggests:\n- Tests didn't run at all due to fatal errors\n- Coverage tool wasn't properly initialized or executed\n- Test environment is severely misconfigured\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n**Environment corruption detected** - Modified files are all within `.venv\\Lib\\site-packages\\coverage\\`:\n- Coverage package files were altered in virtual environment\n- This indicates either manual edits to installed packages or corruption\n- Likely causing the coverage module to malfunction\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Recreate virtual environment** - Delete `.venv` and run `python -m venv .venv`\n2. **Reinstall dependencies** - `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n3. **Verify test runner configuration** - Check pytest/coverage configuration files\n4. **Run basic test first** - Execute a simple test without coverage to verify test infrastructure\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- No reliable test feedback\n- Potential environment instability\n- Impossible to assess actual code quality\n- Deployment would be extremely risky\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution before any further development or deployment.",
