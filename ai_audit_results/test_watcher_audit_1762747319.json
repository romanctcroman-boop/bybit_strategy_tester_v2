    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely unhandled exception during test setup/execution). Test infrastructure itself appears broken.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code is being executed during tests. This represents a complete testing blackout. All business logic in `deepseek_client.py` is untested.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Test Infrastructure Break**: Recent changes to `test_deepseek_client.py` likely introduced fatal errors\n2. **Import/Dependency Issues**: Possible broken imports between test and implementation files\n3. **Configuration Problems**: Test environment setup may be failing\n4. **Syntax/Runtime Errors**: Recent code changes may contain fatal errors preventing test execution\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. **Fix Test Execution First**\n   - Run tests with `-v` flag to see specific failure points\n   - Check for import errors: `from reliability.deepseek_client import DeepSeekClient`\n   - Verify test file structure and pytest configuration\n\n2. **Restore Basic Testing**\n   - Create a simple smoke test to verify basic functionality\n   - Ensure tests can import and instantiate the client\n   - Fix any circular imports or module path issues\n\n3. **Then Address Coverage**\n   - Start with critical path testing (authentication, basic API calls)\n   - Add error handling tests\n   - Build up to comprehensive coverage\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deploying with 0% test coverage is extremely dangerous:\n- **Regression Risk**: 100% - any change could break functionality\n- **Production Failure Risk**: High - untested API integrations\n- **Maintenance Risk**: Critical - no safety net for future changes\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
