Zero coverage suggests tests aren't even running.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **Total Coverage: 0.00%** - No code is being executed during testing\n- **No file-specific coverage data** - Tests are failing before coverage collection begins\n- **Critical gap**: Entire test suite is non-functional\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Broken imports** in `analysis_tools.py` or its dependencies\n2. **Missing dependencies** or environment configuration issues\n3. **Syntax errors** in the modified file preventing module loading\n4. **Test framework configuration** problems (pytest/unittest setup)\n5. **Circular imports** or module initialization failures\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Fix test execution first**:\n   - Run tests with `-v` flag to see specific failure details\n   - Check Python path and import statements in `analysis_tools.py`\n   - Verify all dependencies are installed (`pip list`)\n\n2. **Debug the exit code -1**:\n   - Check for unhandled exceptions in test setup\n   - Review recent changes to `analysis_tools.py` for syntax issues\n   - Validate test configuration files (pytest.ini, conftest.py)\n\n3. **Restore basic functionality**:\n   - Create a simple smoke test to verify module can be imported\n   - Add basic unit tests for core functions before addressing coverage\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Production readiness is compromised because:\n- No code validation is occurring\n- Recent changes cannot be verified\n- Potential for undetected regressions\n- Deployment would be based on untested code\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution immediately before any further development.",
