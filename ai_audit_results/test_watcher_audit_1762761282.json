No tests ran successfully, indicating either:\n- Syntax errors in test code\n- Import failures or dependency issues\n- Test framework configuration problems\n- Fatal errors during test setup\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0.00% coverage** - All coverage metrics are zero because no tests executed. This represents a complete testing failure, not just low coverage.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe failure is directly related to changes in `test_medium_tasks.py`:\n- Likely contains syntax errors or broken imports\n- May have incompatible test framework changes\n- Could be missing required dependencies\n- Possibly contains infinite loops or memory issues causing crashes\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Fix test execution first** - Don't focus on coverage until tests run\n2. **Check `test_medium_tasks.py` for:**\n   - Python syntax errors\n   - Missing imports or modules\n   - Incorrect test decorators\n   - Resource-intensive operations\n3. **Run tests with verbose output** to see exact failure point\n4. **Validate test environment** and dependencies\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - No test feedback means:\n- Undetected regressions in production code\n- No validation of recent changes\n- Potential deployment of broken code\n- Complete loss of testing safety net\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
