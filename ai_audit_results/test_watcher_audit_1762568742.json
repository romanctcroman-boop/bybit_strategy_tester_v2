    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1), indicating fundamental issues with the test environment, dependencies, or test code structure. No meaningful quality assessment possible as tests didn't run.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This represents a complete testing failure rather than coverage gaps.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **health_check.py likely contains syntax errors** or import issues preventing test execution\n2. **Missing dependencies** or environment configuration problems\n3. **Test framework setup failure** - pytest/unittest not properly configured\n4. **Code in health_check.py may be unimportable** due to structural issues\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. Run `python -m py_compile health_check.py` to check for syntax errors\n2. Execute tests with `python -m pytest -v` to see detailed failure reasons\n3. Verify all imports in health_check.py are available in test environment\n4. Check test configuration files (pytest.ini, conftest.py, requirements.txt)\n\n**FOLLOW-UP:**\n- Add basic smoke test to verify test framework functionality\n- Implement CI pipeline validation to catch environment issues early\n- Ensure test dependencies match development environment\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - The complete test failure means:\n- No validation of health_check.py functionality\n- Potential runtime errors in production\n- Undetected regressions in recent changes\n- Broken deployment pipeline if tests block releases\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
