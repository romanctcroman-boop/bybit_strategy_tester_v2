    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely uncaught exception or system error). No tests executed successfully.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% coverage** - No code was executed during testing. This represents complete testing failure, not just poor coverage.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe file `fix_ide_problems_direct.py` likely contains:\n- Syntax errors preventing import/execution\n- Missing dependencies or imports\n- Runtime errors during module loading\n- Infinite loops or blocking operations\n- Environment configuration issues\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. Run `python -m py_compile fix_ide_problems_direct.py` to check for syntax errors\n2. Execute the file directly: `python fix_ide_problems_direct.py` to identify runtime issues\n3. Add basic error handling and logging to diagnose startup failures\n4. Verify all imports and dependencies are available\n\n**Testing Fixes:**\n- Start with minimal test that imports the module\n- Add unit tests for individual functions before integration\n- Implement try-catch blocks around test setup\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - The codebase is completely untested and potentially unstable. Deployment would be extremely risky. This indicates fundamental issues with code quality or development environment.\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution before any further development or deployment.",
