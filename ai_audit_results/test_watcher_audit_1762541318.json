    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely unhandled exception or environment crash). Zero coverage suggests tests aren't even executing.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **0% coverage** across all files\n- No test execution means no coverage data collected\n- Complete testing blackout - cannot assess actual coverage gaps\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Test infrastructure broken** - Recent changes to network/disk failure tests likely introduced:\n   - Import errors or dependency issues\n   - Environment configuration problems\n   - Fixture/setup code crashes\n   - Infinite loops or resource exhaustion\n\n2. **Common culprits:**\n   - Missing imports in new test files\n   - Broken test configuration/setup\n   - Resource cleanup failures\n   - Mock/patch conflicts\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. Run tests individually to identify crashing test:\n   ```bash\n   python -m pytest tests/recovery/test_network_failure.py -v\n   python -m pytest tests/recovery/test_disk_full.py -v\n   ```\n\n2. Check test setup/teardown methods for unhandled exceptions\n\n3. Verify all imports and dependencies are available\n\n**Follow-up:**\n- Add try/catch blocks in test setup with detailed error logging\n- Implement test isolation to prevent cascade failures\n- Add pre-commit hooks to validate test syntax\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Production deployment would be extremely dangerous:\n- No validation of recovery mechanisms\n- Network/disk failure scenarios completely untested\n- Critical system failures could go undetected\n- **Recommend blocking deployments until resolved**\n\n**Priority:** Fix test infrastructure immediately before any further development.",
