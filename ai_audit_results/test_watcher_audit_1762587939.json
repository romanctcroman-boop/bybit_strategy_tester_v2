    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1) with 0% coverage, indicating either:\n- Test environment/setup issues\n- Fatal errors in test code or application code\n- Missing dependencies or configuration\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**COMPLETE COVERAGE BREAKDOWN** - 0% coverage across all files suggests:\n- Tests aren't executing at all\n- Possible import/initialization failures\n- No actual test execution occurred\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nBased on changed files, likely culprits:\n1. **Database migration issues** (`test_alembic_migration.py`)\n2. **Exchange adapter integration failures** (Bybit/Binance adapters)\n3. **Task engine/core changes** breaking test setup\n4. **Idempotency or backtest task logic** causing fatal errors\n\n## Immediate Action Recommendations\n\n**HIGH PRIORITY:**\n1. Check test logs for the specific error causing exit code -1\n2. Verify database connectivity and migration state\n3. Test exchange adapter initialization in isolation\n4. Run tests individually to identify the failing component\n\n**MEDIUM PRIORITY:**\n1. Add try-catch blocks around test setup\n2. Implement health checks before test execution\n3. Create smoke tests for critical components\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- Production deployment would likely fail\n- Critical business logic (trading adapters, backtesting) is untested\n- Potential data integrity issues with migrations\n- Financial operations at risk due to exchange adapter failures\n\n**Start by running `pytest -v tests/integration/test_alembic_migration.py` to isolate the migration test failure, as this is often the root cause of complete test suite failures.**",
