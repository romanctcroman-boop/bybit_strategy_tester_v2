    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1) with 0% coverage. The test suite is non-functional and provides zero quality assurance.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **Total coverage: 0%** - No code is being tested\n- **No coverage data available** - Tests aren't even reaching the execution phase\n- **Complete testing gap** - Entire codebase is untested\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **conftest.py modifications** likely broke test infrastructure (fixtures, setup, imports)\n2. **test_apis.py changes** may contain syntax errors, import issues, or incompatible changes\n3. **Possible circular imports** or dependency conflicts between test files\n4. **Environment configuration** issues (missing dependencies, path problems)\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. Run tests with `-v` flag to see specific failure details\n2. Check `conftest.py` for syntax errors and fixture definitions\n3. Validate imports in both test files\n4. Run tests individually to isolate the failing component\n\n**Short-term:**\n1. Fix the root cause preventing test execution\n2. Add basic smoke tests to prevent complete suite failure\n3. Implement test environment validation\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - No testing feedback means:\n- Undetected bugs in production code\n- Breaking changes go unnoticed\n- Deployment carries significant failure risk\n- Code quality cannot be measured or maintained\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development.",
