    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates a fatal error during test execution, likely preventing any tests from running.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code coverage was collected, confirming tests didn't execute properly. This represents maximum risk for the changed files.\n\n## Potential Issues\n1. **Test Harness Failure**: Import errors, configuration issues, or environment problems\n2. **Syntax Errors**: Recent changes introduced breaking syntax in test or production code\n3. **Dependency Issues**: Missing imports or broken dependencies in the integration test\n4. **Circular Imports**: Possible between circuit_breaker.py and test_integration_retry_circuit_breaker.py\n\n## Immediate Actions Required\n1. **Run tests individually** to isolate the failure:\n   ```bash\n   python -m pytest tests/test_integration_retry_circuit_breaker.py -v\n   python -m pytest reliability/circuit_breaker.py -v\n   ```\n2. **Check for syntax errors** in both changed files\n3. **Verify imports** - ensure test can import from reliability module\n4. **Examine test setup/teardown** for runtime errors\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Changes are completely untested. Circuit breaker functionality is critical for system reliability. Integration tests failing suggests broader impact on retry mechanisms.\n\n## Priority Recommendations\n1. **Fix test execution first** - address the fatal error preventing test runs\n2. **Add unit test coverage** for circuit_breaker.py before integration tests\n3. **Verify circuit breaker logic** manually since automated validation is unavailable\n4. **Implement CI gate** to block deployments with 0% coverage on modified files\n\n**Immediate focus**: Resolve the test execution failure, then rebuild test coverage systematically.",
