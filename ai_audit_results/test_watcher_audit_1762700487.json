    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1). No meaningful test quality can be assessed as tests didn't run to completion. This indicates either catastrophic test infrastructure issues or severe code defects preventing test execution.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0.00% coverage** - No code was executed during testing. This is not a coverage gap but a complete test execution failure.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe schema changes in `backend\\api\\schemas.py` likely introduced:\n- **Syntax errors** preventing module import\n- **Circular imports** breaking dependency chain\n- **Missing dependencies** or incompatible type definitions\n- **Runtime exceptions** during module loading\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Fix test execution first**:\n   - Check Python syntax: `python -m py_compile backend/api/schemas.py`\n   - Verify imports work: `python -c \"from backend.api import schemas\"`\n   - Examine test runner configuration and dependencies\n\n2. **Debug schema changes**:\n   - Review recent commits to `schemas.py` for obvious syntax issues\n   - Check for missing imports, undefined variables, or type errors\n   - Validate Pydantic model definitions if using data validation\n\n3. **Add basic smoke test**:\n   ```python\n   # tests/test_schemas_smoke.py\n   def test_schemas_import():\n       from backend.api import schemas\n       assert schemas is not None\n   ```\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Production deployment would likely fail with same exit code. The codebase is currently untestable and potentially broken. All development should pause until basic test execution is restored.\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution immediately before any further development or analysis.",
