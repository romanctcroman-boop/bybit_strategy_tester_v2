    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1). No tests ran successfully, indicating either:\n- Syntax/runtime errors in test files\n- Test environment configuration issues\n- Missing dependencies or setup requirements\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% coverage** - No code was executed during testing. This is a severe regression indicating:\n- Tests are completely broken\n- No production code paths were exercised\n- All previous coverage has been lost\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **test_watcher_parallel.py modifications** likely introduced breaking changes\n2. **add_deepseek_keys.py** may have dependency or import issues\n3. Possible circular imports or module initialization failures\n4. Environment variables or configuration missing\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Fix test execution first**:\n   - Run tests with `-v` flag to see specific failures\n   - Check for syntax errors: `python -m py_compile [file]`\n   - Verify imports and dependencies\n\n2. **Investigate parallel test changes**:\n   - Review modifications to test_watcher_parallel.py\n   - Check for multiprocessing/synchronization issues\n   - Ensure test discovery still works\n\n3. **Validate new module**:\n   - Test add_deepseek_keys.py independently\n   - Verify it doesn't break existing imports\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state:\n- No working test suite\n- Zero quality gates\n- High probability of undetected regressions\n- Deployment would be extremely risky\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
