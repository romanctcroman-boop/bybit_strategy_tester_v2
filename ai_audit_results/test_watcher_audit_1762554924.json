No tests executed successfully.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This represents complete testing failure, not just poor coverage.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Server.py modifications** likely introduced:\n   - Fatal runtime errors preventing test execution\n   - Import/circular dependency issues\n   - Environment configuration breaks\n   - Missing dependencies in test environment\n\n## Immediate Actions Required\n1. **Debug Test Infrastructure**\n   - Check test runner configuration\n   - Verify dependencies are installed in test environment\n   - Examine test logs for crash details\n\n2. **Fix Server.py**\n   - Add basic error handling and logging\n   - Test imports and dependencies locally\n   - Create minimal smoke test to verify server starts\n\n3. **Emergency Testing**\n   ```python\n   # Add to server.py for immediate validation\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       try:\n           # Basic functionality test\n           print(\"Server basic check: PASS\")\n       except Exception as e:\n           print(f\"Server broken: {e}\")\n   ```\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Production deployment would fail. Complete loss of testing capability means undetected regressions are guaranteed.",
