    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1). No meaningful quality assessment possible as tests didn't run to completion. This indicates fundamental issues with the test infrastructure or codebase.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0.00% coverage** - All tests failed before coverage could be measured. This represents a complete testing breakdown.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **health_check.py changes likely introduced fatal errors** preventing test execution\n2. Possible issues:\n   - Syntax errors in health_check.py\n   - Import/circular dependency issues\n   - Missing dependencies or environment setup\n   - Runtime exceptions during test discovery/import\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. Run `python -m py_compile health_check.py` to check for syntax errors\n2. Execute `python -c \"import health_check\"` to verify the module loads\n3. Run tests with `-v` flag to see specific failure points\n4. Check test runner configuration and dependencies\n\n**Follow-up:**\n- Add basic smoke tests for health_check.py\n- Implement CI pipeline that fails fast on syntax/import issues\n- Set up pre-commit hooks for basic code validation\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Production deployment would be extremely risky:\n- No test validation of recent changes\n- Unknown if health_check.py functions correctly\n- Potential for runtime failures in production\n- Complete loss of testing safety net\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
