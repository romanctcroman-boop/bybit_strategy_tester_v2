    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1). No tests ran successfully, indicating fundamental issues in test setup or code under test.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**ZERO COVERAGE** - 0.00% overall coverage confirms no tests executed. All code paths are untested.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **test_task_queue_new.py** likely contains syntax errors, import failures, or runtime exceptions\n2. Possible circular imports or missing dependencies in the new test file\n3. Test infrastructure may be broken (fixtures, setup/teardown methods)\n4. Recent code changes may have introduced breaking changes to the test environment\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. Run `python -m pytest tests/test_task_queue_new.py -v` to see specific error details\n2. Check for syntax errors in the new test file\n3. Verify all imports and dependencies are available\n4. Examine test setup/teardown methods for exceptions\n\n**FOLLOW-UP:**\n5. Fix the root cause preventing test execution\n6. Add basic smoke tests to validate test infrastructure\n7. Implement CI checks to catch test failures before merge\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - No test validation means:\n- Production code changes are completely untested\n- Regression risks are extremely high\n- Deployment carries significant stability concerns\n- Critical bugs could reach production undetected\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
