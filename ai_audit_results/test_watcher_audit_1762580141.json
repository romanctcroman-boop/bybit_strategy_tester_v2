    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates the test runner crashed before executing any tests. This represents a complete testing breakdown.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0.00% coverage** confirms no tests executed. All code paths are untested and potentially broken.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n- `health_check.py` modifications likely introduced syntax errors, import issues, or runtime exceptions\n- Test configuration may be broken (missing dependencies, incorrect paths, environment issues)\n- Possible circular imports or module initialization failures\n\n## Immediate Actions Required\n1. **Fix Test Execution First**\n   - Check for syntax errors in `health_check.py`: `python -m py_compile health_check.py`\n   - Verify imports and dependencies\n   - Run with verbose output: `pytest -vvs` to see where it fails\n\n2. **Validate Test Configuration**\n   - Ensure pytest configuration files are intact\n   - Check for missing test dependencies\n   - Verify Python path and module structure\n\n3. **Incremental Recovery**\n   - Start with minimal test: `pytest -k \"test_smoke\" --tb=short`\n   - Fix one issue at a time\n   - Add basic smoke test for `health_check.py`\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Code is completely untested and potentially unstable. Do not deploy until:\n- Tests execute successfully (Exit code 0)\n- Basic smoke tests pass\n- Critical path coverage reaches >80%\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution immediately before any further development.",
