    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1). No tests ran successfully, indicating either:\n- Syntax errors in test files or code\n- Missing dependencies/environment setup\n- Test framework configuration issues\n- Fatal errors during test discovery\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This is a direct result of test execution failure, not a coverage measurement issue.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe modified file `backend\\security\\secure_storage.py` likely contains:\n- Syntax errors preventing import/execution\n- Missing imports or dependencies\n- Breaking changes to class/method signatures\n- Configuration issues in the security module\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n\n1. **Fix Test Execution First**\n   - Check test runner logs for specific error messages\n   - Verify Python syntax in `secure_storage.py`\n   - Ensure all imports are available in test environment\n\n2. **Validate Recent Changes**\n   - Review `secure_storage.py` for syntax errors\n   - Test the module import in isolation: `python -c \"from backend.security import secure_storage\"`\n   - Check for circular imports or missing dependencies\n\n3. **Infrastructure Check**\n   - Verify test environment setup\n   - Confirm all requirements are installed\n   - Check test configuration files\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deploying without passing tests is extremely dangerous, especially for security-related code. The secure storage module likely handles sensitive data (credentials, keys, tokens), making failures particularly critical.\n\n## Action Plan\n1. Immediately fix test execution - start with basic import tests\n2. Once tests run, focus on achieving meaningful coverage for security components\n3. Prioritize testing encryption/decryption, key management, and access control paths\n4. Implement security-specific test cases for edge cases and failure scenarios\n\n**First step:** Identify why tests won't run at all - this is blocking all quality assessment.",
