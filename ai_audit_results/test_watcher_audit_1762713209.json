    "analysis": "Based on the test results, here are the key insights:\n\n## 1. Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely broken\n- Exit code -1 indicates abnormal termination (segmentation fault, crash, or fatal error)\n- No tests executed successfully\n- Test infrastructure itself may be compromised\n\n## 2. Coverage Analysis\n**ZERO COVERAGE** - All metrics at 0.00%\n- No code was executed during test run\n- This indicates tests never reached actual test execution phase\n- Coverage reporting system may have failed entirely\n\n## 3. Potential Issues\n**High Risk Changes Detected:**\n- Pytest core files modified in `.venv` (should never happen)\n- `conftest.py` changes combined with pytest internal modifications\n- Likely causes:\n  - Corrupted virtual environment\n  - Monkeypatching gone wrong in conftest\n  - Fixture conflicts causing pytest crash\n\n## 4. Recommendations\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. **Recreate virtual environment** - Delete `.venv` and start fresh\n2. **Verify conftest.py** - Check for dangerous monkeypatching or fixture overrides\n3. **Run minimal test** - Start with single simple test to isolate the crash\n4. **Check pytest version** - Ensure compatible pytest version\n\n**Follow-up:**\n- Review recent changes to `conftest.py` for pytest internals modification\n- Remove any patches to pytest internal modules\n- Implement test environment isolation\n\n## 5. Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Development/testing blocked\n- No reliable testing possible\n- Production code changes cannot be validated\n- Critical bugs could go undetected\n- **Priority: Fix immediately before any further development**\n\n**Root Cause Likelihood:** Corrupted test environment (85%), Dangerous conftest modifications (15%)",
