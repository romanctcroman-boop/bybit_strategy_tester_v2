    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test suite failed to execute (Exit Code -1). No meaningful quality assessment possible as tests didn't run. This indicates either:\n- Syntax errors in test files or code\n- Missing dependencies/environment setup\n- Test framework configuration issues\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0.00% coverage** - No code was executed during testing. This is a direct result of test execution failure, not a coverage gap issue.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe modified `backend\\strategies\\base.py` likely contains:\n- Syntax errors preventing import/execution\n- Breaking changes to class/method signatures\n- Missing imports or dependencies\n- Circular import issues\n\n## Recommendations\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. **Fix test execution** - Check test runner output for specific error messages\n2. **Validate syntax** - Run `python -m py_compile backend/strategies/base.py`\n3. **Check imports** - Verify all dependencies are available in test environment\n4. **Run minimal test** - Create a simple test to isolate the failure point\n\n**Follow-up:**\n5. Add pre-commit hooks for syntax validation\n6. Ensure CI environment matches development setup\n7. Implement basic smoke tests before full test suite\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Cannot deploy with failing test suite:\n- No confidence in code changes\n- Potential runtime errors in production\n- Broken functionality in strategy base class\n- All dependent modules at risk\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
