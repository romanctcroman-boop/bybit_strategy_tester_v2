No meaningful test results were generated.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% COVERAGE** - Complete coverage failure. No code was tested, indicating either:\n- Test infrastructure failure\n- Test execution was aborted before coverage collection\n- Critical import/configuration errors\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Virtual environment corruption** - Changes to `.venv\\Lib\\site-packages\\psycopg2\\__init__.py` suggest environment issues\n2. **Database dependency failure** - `psycopg2` (PostgreSQL adapter) modifications likely broke test setup\n3. **Test file isolation** - `temp_pg_test.py` appears to be a temporary file, potentially incomplete or misconfigured\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. **Restore clean virtual environment** - Delete `.venv` and recreate with `python -m venv .venv`\n2. **Verify database connectivity** - Test PostgreSQL connection independently\n3. **Fix test execution** - Run tests with `-v` flag to see specific failure points\n4. **Remove temporary files** - Replace `temp_pg_test.py` with proper test files\n\n**FOLLOW-UP:**\n- Implement basic smoke tests before full test suite\n- Add test environment validation checks\n- Use dependency pinning to prevent package corruption\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- No reliable testing pipeline\n- Potential environment instability\n- Database integration issues\n- **Unsafe to deploy** - Zero confidence in code quality\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
