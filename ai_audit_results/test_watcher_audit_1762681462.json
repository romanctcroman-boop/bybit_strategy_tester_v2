    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test suite failed to execute (Exit Code -1). No meaningful quality assessment possible as tests didn't run. This indicates fundamental issues with test infrastructure or code.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0.00% coverage** - No code was executed during testing. This represents a complete testing failure, not just low coverage.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n- **run_full_project_audit.py** modifications likely introduced fatal errors\n- Possible issues: syntax errors, import failures, missing dependencies, infinite loops, or environment configuration problems\n- Test runner unable to initialize or execute any tests\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n1. **Immediate Action**: Debug why tests won't run\n   - Check syntax: `python -m py_compile run_full_project_audit.py`\n   - Test imports manually\n   - Verify dependencies are installed\n\n2. **Fix Execution Issues**:\n   - Add try-catch blocks around main execution\n   - Implement proper error handling\n   - Add logging to identify failure points\n\n3. **Restore Basic Testing**:\n   - Get tests running (even with minimal coverage)\n   - Add smoke tests to verify basic functionality\n   - Implement CI pipeline health checks\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - No test validation means:\n- Undetected regressions likely\n- Production deployment extremely risky\n- Code quality cannot be measured\n- Potential for runtime crashes in production\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
