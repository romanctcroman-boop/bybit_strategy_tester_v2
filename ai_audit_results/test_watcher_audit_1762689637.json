    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1). No tests ran successfully, indicating either:\n- Syntax errors in test files or code\n- Missing dependencies/environment setup\n- Test framework configuration issues\n- Fatal errors during test discovery/import\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This is a direct result of test execution failure, not a coverage measurement issue.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n- `health_check.py` modifications likely introduced breaking changes\n- Possible syntax errors, import issues, or runtime exceptions\n- Missing required dependencies for the new code\n- Test environment incompatibility with recent changes\n\n## Recommendations\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. **Fix test execution first** - Run tests with verbose output to identify the root cause\n2. **Check syntax** - Validate `health_check.py` for Python syntax compliance\n3. **Verify imports** - Ensure all dependencies are available in test environment\n4. **Run minimal test** - Create a simple test to verify basic functionality\n\n**Follow-up:**\n5. Once tests execute, implement meaningful test cases for `health_check.py`\n6. Add unit tests covering all major code paths\n7. Set up continuous integration to catch failures early\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Code is completely untested and potentially non-functional. Deployment would be extremely risky. The -1 exit code suggests fundamental issues that could affect production stability.\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
