    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1). No meaningful quality assessment possible as tests didn't run to completion. This indicates fundamental issues with the test environment or test code itself.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This is not a coverage gap but a complete test execution failure.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **health_check.py changes likely broke test execution**\n2. Possible syntax errors or import issues in the modified file\n3. Test framework configuration problems\n4. Dependencies or environment setup failures\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. **Fix test execution first** - Run tests with verbose output to identify the root cause\n2. **Check health_check.py for syntax errors** - Validate the recent changes\n3. **Verify test dependencies** - Ensure all required packages are installed\n4. **Run minimal test** - Start with a single simple test to isolate the issue\n\n**FOLLOW-UP:**\n5. Add pre-commit hooks to catch syntax errors before tests run\n6. Implement CI pipeline that fails fast on syntax/import issues\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - \n- **Deployment Risk**: Cannot verify if health_check.py changes work correctly\n- **Regression Risk**: No confidence in existing functionality\n- **Quality Risk**: Entire test suite is currently useless for quality assurance\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
