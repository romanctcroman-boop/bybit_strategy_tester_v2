    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1) with zero coverage. This indicates either a catastrophic test infrastructure failure or severe code defects preventing test execution.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **Total Coverage: 0%** - No code was executed during testing\n- **No coverage data available** - Test framework failed before collecting metrics\n- **Critical gap**: Unable to assess actual code coverage due to execution failure\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Stress test failure**: The modified `test_parallel_execution.py` likely contains fatal errors\n2. **Possible causes**:\n   - Infinite loops or resource exhaustion in parallel execution\n   - Import/circular dependency issues\n   - Environment configuration problems\n   - Memory leaks crashing test runner\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. **Isolate the failing test**: Run `test_parallel_execution.py` in isolation to identify the specific failure\n2. **Add debug output**: Instrument the test with logging to pinpoint where it fails\n3. **Check resource limits**: Verify memory, thread, and process limits aren't being exceeded\n4. **Rollback and test**: Temporarily revert the stress test changes to verify system stability\n\n**STRUCTURAL IMPROVEMENTS:**\n1. Implement test timeouts for stress tests\n2. Add resource monitoring during test execution\n3. Create a staging environment for stress tests\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - The complete test failure means:\n- No validation of existing functionality\n- Potential production issues undetected\n- Development blocked until resolved\n- Possible system instability from parallel execution defects\n\n**Priority**: Resolve immediately before any further development or deployment.",
