    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1) with 0% coverage. This indicates fundamental issues in the test infrastructure or codebase that prevent any meaningful testing.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **Total coverage: 0.00%** - No code was executed during testing\n- **No coverage data available** - Test framework failed before collecting metrics\n- **Critical gap**: Entire codebase remains untested due to execution failure\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe failure likely relates to `run_full_project_audit.py` changes:\n- Syntax errors preventing import/execution\n- Missing dependencies or imports\n- Infinite loops or fatal errors during setup\n- Environment configuration issues\n- Test runner configuration broken\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. **Fix Exit Code -1**: Run tests locally to identify the specific error causing premature termination\n2. **Check `run_full_project_audit.py`**: Verify syntax, imports, and basic functionality\n3. **Validate test configuration**: Ensure pytest/unittest configuration is correct\n\n**Short-term:**\n4. Add basic smoke tests to verify test infrastructure\n5. Implement error handling in test setup/teardown\n6. Add logging to identify failure points\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- No reliable quality assurance\n- Potential undetected regressions\n- Deployment risks significantly increased\n- Technical debt accumulating rapidly\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
