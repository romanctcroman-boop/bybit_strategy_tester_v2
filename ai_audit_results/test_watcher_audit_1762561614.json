This represents a complete testing gap across the entire codebase.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n- The changed file `backend\\config\\__init__.py` likely contains syntax errors, import issues, or configuration problems\n- Possible circular imports or missing dependencies in the config module\n- Environment setup/configuration may be broken\n\n## Immediate Action Items\n1. **Fix Test Execution First**\n   - Check `backend\\config\\__init__.py` for syntax errors\n   - Verify all imports and dependencies are available\n   - Run tests with verbose output to identify the specific failure point\n\n2. **Validate Configuration**\n   - Ensure test environment is properly configured\n   - Check for missing environment variables or configuration files\n   - Verify database connections and external dependencies\n\n3. **Restore Basic Testing**\n   - Get at least one test passing to establish baseline\n   - Focus on unit tests before integration tests\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - No functional testing is occurring, meaning:\n- Undetected bugs could be deployed to production\n- Code changes aren't being validated\n- Regression risks are extremely high\n- Deployment should be blocked until basic test functionality is restored\n\n**Priority: Fix immediately** - This represents a complete breakdown of the testing pipeline that must be resolved before any further development or deployment.",
