No meaningful quality assessment possible as zero tests ran successfully.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% COVERAGE** - Complete coverage failure indicates:\n- Test environment/bootstrap failure\n- No production code executed\n- Critical configuration/import issues\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n**Primary Suspect: tests/conftest.py**\n- Syntax errors in pytest configuration\n- Broken fixtures or plugin imports\n- Environment setup failures\n- Import path/circular dependency issues\n- Missing dependencies in test configuration\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. **Debug conftest.py** - Check for syntax errors and import issues\n2. **Run pytest with `-v` flag** to see specific failure point\n3. **Test isolation** - Run `pytest tests/ --tb=short` to identify failing module\n4. **Verify dependencies** - Ensure all test requirements are installed\n\n**Follow-up:**\n5. Add basic smoke test to validate test environment\n6. Implement CI pipeline with fail-fast on test configuration\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Unable to validate any code functionality. Production deployments carry unknown stability risks. Test infrastructure itself is compromised.\n\n**Priority:** Fix test configuration immediately before any further development or deployment.",
