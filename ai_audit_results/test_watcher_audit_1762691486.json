    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely unhandled exception or environment crash). Zero coverage confirms no tests executed successfully.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **0% coverage** across all files\n- No test execution means no coverage data collected\n- Critical gap: Entire test infrastructure appears broken\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe modified files suggest:\n1. **Bollinger Mean Reversion strategy** (`bollinger_mean_reversion.py`) changes may contain syntax errors, import issues, or breaking changes\n2. **Backtest engine** (`backtest_engine.py`) modifications might have introduced circular imports, missing dependencies, or runtime exceptions\n3. Possible environment/dependency conflicts from recent changes\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Debug Test Infrastructure First**\n   - Check test runner configuration and environment setup\n   - Run tests with `-v` flag to see specific failure points\n   - Verify all dependencies are installed and compatible\n\n2. **Isolate the Failure**\n   ```bash\n   python -m pytest backend/ --tb=short -x\n   ```\n   - Identify which test module fails first\n   - Check for import errors in changed files\n\n3. **Validate Recent Changes**\n   - Manually import and instantiate classes from both modified files\n   - Check for syntax errors and missing imports\n   - Verify no circular dependencies between strategy and backtest engine\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deployment would be catastrophic:\n- No functioning test suite\n- Zero quality assurance on recent changes\n- High probability of runtime errors in production\n- **Do not deploy** until exit code is 0 and basic coverage is restored\n\n## Priority Action\nFix the test runner failure first - this is blocking all quality assessment. The code changes cannot be safely evaluated until tests execute successfully.",
