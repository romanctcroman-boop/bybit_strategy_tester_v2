    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1). No meaningful quality assessment possible as tests didn't run to completion. This indicates fundamental issues with the test infrastructure or environment.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This is not a coverage gap but a complete test execution failure.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **health_check.py changes likely broke test execution**\n2. Possible causes:\n   - Syntax errors in the modified file\n   - Import/circular dependency issues\n   - Missing dependencies or environment setup\n   - Test framework configuration broken\n   - Critical exceptions during test discovery/import\n\n## Recommendations\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. **Fix test execution first** - Run tests locally to identify the root cause\n2. **Check health_check.py for syntax/import errors**\n3. **Verify test dependencies and environment setup**\n4. **Run with verbose output** to see where execution fails\n\n**FOLLOW-UP:**\n5. Once tests run, establish baseline coverage\n6. Add specific tests for health_check.py functionality\n7. Implement pre-commit hooks to catch syntax errors\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deploying without functioning tests is extremely dangerous. The codebase is currently untested and may contain critical bugs. No safety net exists for future changes.\n\n**Priority: Fix test execution immediately before any further development.**",
