    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (exit code -1). No meaningful test quality assessment possible as tests didn't run successfully. This indicates either catastrophic test infrastructure issues or severe code defects preventing test execution.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code coverage data collected. This suggests:\n- Tests crashed before coverage collection could begin\n- Test environment setup failed\n- Import/initialization errors in the changed file\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe single changed file `load_keys_and_analyze.py` likely contains:\n- **Syntax errors** preventing module import\n- **Missing dependencies** causing import failures\n- **Runtime exceptions** during module initialization\n- **Infinite loops** or **blocking operations** hanging test execution\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. **Run tests locally** to identify the specific crash point\n2. **Check syntax** of `load_keys_and_analyze.py` with `python -m py_compile`\n3. **Verify imports** and dependencies are available in test environment\n4. **Add basic exception handling** to prevent catastrophic failures\n\n**FOLLOW-UP:**\n5. Implement minimal smoke test to verify basic functionality\n6. Add logging to identify where execution fails\n7. Ensure test environment matches development environment\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Production deployment would likely fail completely. The code appears fundamentally broken and untestable in current state. No safety net exists to catch regressions.\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution failure before any other development continues.",
