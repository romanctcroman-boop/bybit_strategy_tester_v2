This indicates severe infrastructure or configuration issues.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0.00% coverage** - No code was executed during testing. This is not a coverage gap but a complete test execution failure.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Syntax errors** in `task_queue.py` preventing import/execution\n2. **Missing dependencies** or broken imports in the changed file\n3. **Configuration issues** in test runner or environment setup\n4. **Circular imports** introduced by recent changes\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Fix test execution first:**\n   - Run `python -m py_compile backend/api/task_queue.py` to check syntax\n   - Verify imports and dependencies in the changed file\n   - Check test configuration files for errors\n\n2. **Debug steps:**\n   - Run tests with `-v` flag to see where they fail\n   - Check for uncaught exceptions during test setup\n   - Verify all required test dependencies are installed\n\n3. **After fixing execution:**\n   - Add unit tests specifically for `task_queue.py` functionality\n   - Aim for 80%+ coverage on the modified file\n   - Implement integration tests for queue operations\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deploying untested code could cause:\n- Production failures in task queue operations\n- Service downtime if queue processing breaks\n- Data loss or corruption in queue operations\n\n**Block deployment until tests execute successfully and achieve meaningful coverage.**",
