This indicates either:\n- Syntax errors in test files or code\n- Missing dependencies/environment setup\n- Test framework configuration issues\n- Critical runtime exceptions during import/execution\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**ZERO COVERAGE** - 0.00% across all files means:\n- No tests executed successfully\n- Recent changes likely broke the test runner\n- Coverage reporting is non-functional\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe modified files (`circuit_breaker.py`, `health_check.py`) likely contain:\n- Import errors or circular dependencies\n- Syntax errors (Python 2/3 compatibility, missing colons, etc.)\n- Missing required modules/packages\n- Breaking changes to class/method signatures\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Fix Test Execution First**\n   - Check test runner logs for specific error messages\n   - Verify Python environment and dependencies\n   - Run tests individually to isolate the failure point\n\n2. **Validate Recent Changes**\n   - Review `circuit_breaker.py` and `health_check.py` for syntax errors\n   - Check import statements and module dependencies\n   - Ensure no breaking API changes in modified classes/methods\n\n3. **Restore Basic Testing**\n   - Add simple smoke tests for core functionality\n   - Ensure tests can run without exceptions\n   - Re-establish baseline coverage before adding new features\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deploying without passing tests is extremely dangerous:\n- Undetected runtime errors likely exist\n- No validation of circuit breaker or health check logic\n- Potential production outages from unverified reliability components\n- All recent changes are effectively untested\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
