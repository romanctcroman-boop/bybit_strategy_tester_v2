    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1), indicating fundamental issues in test infrastructure or code under test. No meaningful quality assessment possible until basic test execution is resolved.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**ZERO COVERAGE** - 0.00% coverage confirms no tests executed successfully. All code paths are currently untested.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Syntax/Import Errors** in `deepseek_client.py` or `test_deepseek_client.py`\n2. **Missing Dependencies** - Required packages not installed\n3. **Configuration Issues** - Test runner setup broken\n4. **Critical Logic Errors** - Code changes preventing module import/execution\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. Run tests with `-v` flag to see specific failure details\n2. Check Python syntax: `python -m py_compile reliability/deepseek_client.py`\n3. Verify imports work: `python -c \"from reliability.deepseek_client import *\"`\n4. Examine recent git changes for breaking modifications\n\n**Follow-up:**\n- Fix basic test execution before addressing coverage\n- Add smoke tests to validate core functionality\n- Implement CI pipeline to catch similar failures early\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Production code is completely untested. Any defects in `deepseek_client.py` will go undetected. Deploying this code carries significant reliability and stability risks.\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
