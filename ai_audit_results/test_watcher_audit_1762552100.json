    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1). No tests ran successfully, indicating either:\n- Syntax errors in test files or code\n- Missing dependencies/environment setup\n- Test framework configuration issues\n- Fatal errors during test discovery/import\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This is a direct result of the test failure, not a coverage measurement issue.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe changed file `analyze_parallel_with_deepseek.py` likely contains:\n- **Syntax errors** preventing import/execution\n- **Missing imports** or dependencies\n- **Runtime errors** during module loading\n- **Circular imports** or import conflicts\n\n## Immediate Action Items\n\n1. **Fix Test Execution First**\n   ```bash\n   python -m py_compile analyze_parallel_with_deepseek.py\n   ```\n   Check for syntax errors\n\n2. **Verify Imports**\n   - Ensure all required packages are installed\n   - Check for missing module dependencies\n   - Validate import statements\n\n3. **Test Isolation**\n   ```bash\n   python -c \"import analyze_parallel_with_deepseek\"\n   ```\n   Test module import in isolation\n\n4. **Check Test Configuration**\n   - Verify pytest/unittest configuration\n   - Ensure test discovery patterns are correct\n   - Check for conflicting test files\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - The codebase is completely untested and potentially broken. Deployment would be extremely risky without resolving these fundamental issues.\n\n## Priority Recommendations\n1. **Fix test execution** before addressing coverage\n2. **Add basic smoke tests** to verify module functionality\n3. **Implement CI pipeline** to catch these issues earlier\n4. **Review recent changes** to `analyze_parallel_with_deepseek.py` for obvious errors\n\n**Next Step**: Start with basic syntax validation and module import testing. Coverage improvement is irrelevant until tests can execute successfully.",
