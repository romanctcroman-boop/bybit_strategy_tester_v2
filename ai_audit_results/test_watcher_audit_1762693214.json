    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1). No meaningful test quality can be assessed since tests didn't run successfully. This indicates either catastrophic test infrastructure issues or severe code defects preventing test execution.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**ZERO COVERAGE** - 0.00% coverage confirms no tests executed. The empty coverage report suggests:\n- Test runner cannot import/execute the changed file\n- Fatal errors during test discovery or setup\n- Missing dependencies or configuration\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe single changed file `full_ai_audit_deepseek_perplexity_deepseek.py` likely contains:\n- **Syntax errors** preventing import\n- **Missing imports** or dependencies\n- **Runtime errors** in module-level code\n- **Circular imports** or namespace conflicts\n- **Environment-specific code** failing in test environment\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n\n1. **Debug Test Failure First**\n   ```bash\n   python -m pytest --tb=short -x  # Isolate first failing test\n   python -c \"import full_ai_audit_deepseek_perplexity_deepseek\"  # Check import\n   ```\n\n2. **Check Module-Level Code**\n   - Move any executable code from global scope into functions\n   - Add `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` guards\n   - Verify all imports are available in test environment\n\n3. **Validate Test Configuration**\n   - Ensure pytest can discover and import the module\n   - Check for missing test dependencies\n   - Verify PYTHONPATH includes module location\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Production deployment would likely fail with same errors. Zero test coverage means:\n- No validation of recent changes\n- High probability of runtime errors\n- Potential data loss or system instability\n- **Do not deploy** until basic tests pass and coverage >70%\n\n## Priority Action\nFix the import/execution error in the changed file first, then establish minimal test coverage before any further development.",
