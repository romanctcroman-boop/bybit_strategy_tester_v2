    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely unhandled exception or system error). Zero coverage suggests tests never executed properly.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **0% coverage** across all files\n- No test execution occurred\n- Critical gap: Entire codebase untested\n- Test infrastructure appears broken\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **run_perplexity_audit.py** - Likely contains fatal error preventing test execution\n2. **encryption_key_manager.py** - May have breaking changes affecting imports or dependencies\n3. Possible circular imports or missing dependencies in modified files\n4. Syntax errors or runtime exceptions in changed code\n\n## Recommendations\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. Fix test runner - Check run_perplexity_audit.py for syntax/runtime errors\n2. Verify imports and dependencies in both changed files\n3. Run tests with verbose output to identify failure point\n4. Add basic smoke test to validate test infrastructure\n\n**SHORT TERM:**\n1. Implement minimal test suite achieving >80% coverage\n2. Add error handling in test runner to capture and report failures\n3. Set up pre-commit hooks to prevent broken tests\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deploying untested code, especially involving encryption components, poses security and reliability risks. Current state indicates potential for:\n- Production failures\n- Security vulnerabilities in encryption handling\n- Undetected regressions\n- Broken functionality in dependent systems\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
