    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1) with 0% coverage. This indicates either catastrophic test infrastructure issues or severe code defects preventing any tests from running.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **Total coverage: 0.00%** - No code was executed during testing\n- **No coverage data available** - Test execution halted before coverage collection\n- **Critical gap**: Entire codebase remains untested\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **File `full_ai_audit_deepseek_perplexity_deepseek.py` likely contains:**\n   - Syntax errors preventing import/execution\n   - Fatal runtime errors during module loading\n   - Missing dependencies or imports\n   - Infinite loops or blocking operations\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. **Debug test execution failure:**\n   ```bash\n   python -m py_compile full_ai_audit_deepseek_perplexity_deepseek.py\n   ```\n2. **Run tests with verbose output to identify failure point**\n3. **Check for missing imports or dependencies**\n4. **Validate file executes without errors:**\n   ```python\n   python -c \"import full_ai_audit_deepseek_perplexity_deepseek\"\n   ```\n\n**Follow-up:**\n5. Add basic smoke tests before comprehensive coverage\n6. Implement CI pipeline with syntax checking\n7. Add module-level try/except blocks for better error reporting\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- Production code may be completely broken\n- No validation of functionality\n- Potential deployment of non-functional code\n- Complete lack of quality assurance\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
