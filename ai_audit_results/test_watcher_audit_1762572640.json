    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1). No tests ran successfully, indicating either:\n- Syntax errors in test files or code\n- Missing dependencies/environment setup\n- Test framework configuration issues\n- Fatal errors during test discovery/import\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This is a direct result of test execution failure, not a coverage measurement issue.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n- `health_check.py` modifications likely introduced breaking changes\n- Possible syntax errors, import issues, or runtime exceptions\n- Environment/dependency mismatches preventing test execution\n\n## Recommendations\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. **Fix test execution first** - Run tests with verbose output to identify the root cause\n2. **Check syntax** - Validate `health_check.py` for basic Python syntax compliance\n3. **Verify imports** - Ensure all dependencies are available and imports work\n4. **Test isolation** - Run a simple smoke test to verify basic functionality\n\n**Follow-up:**\n5. Once tests execute, establish baseline coverage\n6. Add specific tests for `health_check.py` functionality\n7. Implement CI checks to prevent zero-coverage commits\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Code is completely untested and potentially broken. Deployment would be extremely risky. The -1 exit code suggests fundamental issues that need immediate resolution before any meaningful quality assessment can occur.\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution as the absolute first step - coverage analysis is meaningless until tests actually run.",
