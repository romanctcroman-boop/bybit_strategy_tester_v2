    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure before any tests could execute. This represents a complete testing breakdown.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **0% coverage** - No code was executed during testing\n- All files show empty coverage data\n- Testing infrastructure itself appears broken\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Test runner failure** - Likely syntax errors, import issues, or environment problems in `test_cross_agent.py`\n2. **Dependency breakage** - Changes in `monitor_performance.py` may have broken test imports or setup\n3. **Configuration issues** - Test configuration or runner setup may be corrupted\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Fix test execution first**:\n   - Check for syntax errors in `test_cross_agent.py`\n   - Verify imports between changed files work correctly\n   - Run tests with `-v` flag to see where they fail\n2. **Validate test environment**:\n   - Ensure all dependencies are installed\n   - Check pytest/unitest configuration\n3. **Add basic smoke test** to prevent complete test suite collapse\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Code is completely untested. Any bugs in `monitor_performance.py` changes are undetectable. Deployment would be extremely risky.\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development.",
