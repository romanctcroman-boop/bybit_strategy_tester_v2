    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely unhandled exception or environment crash).\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code executed during test run. This represents complete testing failure, not just poor coverage.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **send_validation_to_ai.py changes likely broke test infrastructure**\n2. Possible infinite loops or memory exhaustion\n3. Import/circular dependency issues\n4. Environment configuration failures\n5. Test runner crash during setup\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **ROLLBACK** the changes to send_validation_to_ai.py immediately\n2. Run tests on previous working version to confirm baseline functionality\n3. **Fix in isolation:**\n   - Add extensive logging to identify crash point\n   - Test the changed file in isolation with minimal imports\n   - Add try/catch blocks around new functionality\n4. Implement test environment monitoring to detect resource exhaustion\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Production deployment would be catastrophic:\n- No validation of any functionality\n- Potential for silent failures in production\n- Complete loss of testing safety net\n- High probability of undetected regressions\n\n**Priority:** Fix test infrastructure before any further development or deployment.",
