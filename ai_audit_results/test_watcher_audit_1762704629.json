    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1) with 0% coverage. The test infrastructure itself is broken, making quality assessment impossible.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**COMPLETE COVERAGE FAILURE** - No code was executed during testing. All test coverage is missing.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n- **Primary suspect**: `tests\\backend\\conftest.py` modifications broke the test framework\n- Likely issues:\n  - Syntax errors in conftest fixtures\n  - Import failures or circular dependencies\n  - Fixture configuration errors preventing test collection\n  - Environment setup failures\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. **Debug conftest.py** - Check for syntax errors, import issues, fixture definitions\n2. **Run pytest with `-v` flag** to see specific failure details\n3. **Test isolation** - Run individual test files to identify scope of breakage\n4. **Rollback** recent conftest changes if quick fix isn't apparent\n\n**STRUCTURAL IMPROVEMENTS:**\n1. Add pre-commit hooks to validate test configuration\n2. Implement CI pipeline that fails fast on configuration errors\n3. Create smoke tests for test infrastructure\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - \n- **Development blocked**: No reliable testing available\n- **Regression risk**: Code changes can't be validated\n- **Deployment risk**: Production issues likely if deployed without testing\n- **Team velocity impact**: All developers affected until resolved\n\n**Priority: CRITICAL** - Fix test infrastructure immediately before any further development.",
