This indicates either catastrophic test infrastructure issues or severe code defects preventing any tests from running.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **Total coverage: 0.00%** - No code was executed during testing\n- **No coverage data available** - Test framework likely crashed before collecting metrics\n- **Critical gap**: Unable to assess actual code coverage due to test failure\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **File `full_ai_audit_deepseek_perplexity_deepseek.py` likely contains:**\n   - Syntax errors preventing import/execution\n   - Fatal runtime errors during module loading\n   - Missing dependencies or imports\n   - Infinite loops or memory issues during initialization\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. **Debug test execution failure:**\n   ```bash\n   python -m py_compile full_ai_audit_deepseek_perplexity_deepseek.py\n   ```\n2. **Check for basic syntax/runtime errors:**\n   ```bash\n   python -c \"import full_ai_audit_deepseek_perplexity_deepseek\"\n   ```\n3. **Run tests with verbose output to identify failure point**\n\n**Follow-up Actions:**\n- Add basic smoke tests to verify module can be imported\n- Implement error handling for module initialization\n- Set up pre-commit hooks to catch syntax errors\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- Production code may be completely broken\n- No validation of recent changes\n- Potential for undetected runtime errors\n- Complete loss of test feedback loop\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
