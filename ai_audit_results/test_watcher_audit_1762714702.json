    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely unhandled exception during test setup/execution).\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% coverage** - No code is being executed during tests. This suggests:\n- Test runner cannot import modules\n- Fixtures/setup are failing before any tests run\n- Import errors or dependency issues\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Import/Dependency Problems** - Changes in `perplexity_client.py` likely broke imports\n2. **Module Structure Issues** - Incorrect package/module organization\n3. **Missing Dependencies** - Required packages not installed in test environment\n4. **Syntax Errors** - Python cannot parse the modified files\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Fix Import Issues**\n   ```bash\n   python -c \"from reliability.perplexity_client import *\"\n   ```\n   Run this to identify import errors\n\n2. **Check Basic Syntax**\n   ```bash\n   python -m py_compile reliability/perplexity_client.py\n   ```\n\n3. **Run Tests with Verbose Output**\n   ```bash\n   python -m pytest tests/test_perplexity_client.py -v\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify Test Structure**\n   - Ensure `__init__.py` files exist in packages\n   - Check test imports match module structure\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Production code changes are completely untested. Any defects will reach production undetected.\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before further development. Current state provides zero quality assurance.",
