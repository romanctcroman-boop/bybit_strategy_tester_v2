    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1). No meaningful test quality can be assessed since tests didn't run successfully. This indicates either catastrophic test infrastructure issues or severe code defects preventing test execution.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This represents the worst-case coverage scenario where:\n- No functions/methods were tested\n- No branches or paths were executed\n- No import/initialization code ran successfully\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe single changed file `full_ai_audit_deepseek_perplexity_deepseek.py` likely contains:\n- **Syntax errors** preventing import/execution\n- **Missing dependencies** causing import failures\n- **Runtime errors** during module initialization\n- **Infinite loops** or **blocking operations** during import\n- **Environment configuration** issues\n\n## Immediate Action Recommendations\n\n**1. Fix Test Execution First:**\n```bash\npython -m py_compile full_ai_audit_deepseek_perplexity_deepseek.py\n```\nCheck for syntax errors before running tests.\n\n**2. Debug Import Issues:**\n```python\n# Test import manually\ntry:\n    from full_ai_audit_deepseek_perplexity_deepseek import *\n    print(\"Import successful\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Import failed: {e}\")\n```\n\n**3. Isolate Test Failures:**\n- Run tests with `-v` flag for verbose output\n- Check test setup/teardown methods\n- Verify test dependencies are installed\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- **Zero test validation** of recent changes\n- **Production deployment risk** is extremely high\n- **Regression risk** for any dependent functionality\n- **Code quality unknown** - could contain critical bugs\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
