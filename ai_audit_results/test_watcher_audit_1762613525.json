Exit code -1 indicates a fatal error preventing test execution, likely due to environment or dependency issues.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% coverage** - No code is being executed during testing. This represents a complete testing failure, not just low coverage.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Environment corruption** - Modified files include `.venv\\Lib\\site-packages\\psycopg2\\__init__.py`, suggesting virtual environment tampering\n2. **Dependency conflicts** - Changes to psycopg2 (PostgreSQL adapter) likely broke database connectivity\n3. **Test infrastructure failure** - Modified `temp_pg_test.py` may contain fatal errors\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. **Recreate virtual environment** - Delete `.venv` and rebuild with clean dependencies\n2. **Verify database connectivity** - Ensure PostgreSQL is running and credentials are correct\n3. **Fix `temp_pg_test.py`** - Review recent changes for syntax errors or import issues\n4. **Run basic connectivity test** before full test suite\n\n**FOLLOW-UP:**\n- Implement pre-commit hooks to prevent venv modifications\n- Add environment sanity checks to test setup\n- Consider using Docker for consistent test environments\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - No testing is occurring, meaning:\n- All code changes are untested\n- Production deployments are extremely risky\n- Potential for undetected regressions and bugs\n- Database integration likely broken\n\n**Priority: Fix immediately before any further development.**",
