This indicates severe issues in either test infrastructure or catastrophic test failures that prevent any meaningful execution.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% coverage** - No code was executed successfully. This suggests:\n- Test runner crashed before collecting any coverage data\n- Import/initialization failures in test files\n- Environment/dependency issues preventing test execution\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe changed file `tests\\test_edge_cases_stress.py` is likely the culprit:\n- **Syntax errors** preventing import/execution\n- **Infinite loops** or resource exhaustion in stress tests\n- **Missing dependencies** or imports\n- **Environment configuration** issues\n- **Memory overflows** or system resource limits being hit\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. **Isolate the failing test**: Run `test_edge_cases_stress.py` in isolation to identify the crash\n2. **Check for syntax errors**: Validate Python syntax in the changed file\n3. **Add resource limits**: Implement timeouts and memory limits for stress tests\n4. **Review test infrastructure**: Ensure test runner configuration is correct\n\n**Long-term:**\n- Implement test execution with `--fail-fast` to prevent cascading failures\n- Add pre-commit hooks to validate test syntax\n- Set up resource monitoring for stress tests\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Complete test suite failure means:\n- No validation of existing functionality\n- Potential undetected regressions in production\n- Broken CI/CD pipeline blocking deployments\n- Loss of confidence in test reliability\n\n**Priority**: Fix immediately - this blocks all meaningful testing and deployment activities.",
