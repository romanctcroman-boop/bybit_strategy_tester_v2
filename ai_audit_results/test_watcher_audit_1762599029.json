Implement integration tests for API clients\n2. Add unit tests for analytics engine core logic\n3. Set up continuous test execution monitoring\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Production deployment should be blocked until:\n- ✅ Basic test suite executes successfully\n- ✅ Minimum 70% coverage on changed files\n- ✅ Critical path integration tests pass\n\n**Business Impact:** Potential data corruption, analytics failures, or silent API errors in production.",
