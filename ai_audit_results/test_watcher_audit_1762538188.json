This indicates either:\n- Test framework configuration issues\n- Fatal errors during test setup/import\n- Environment/dependency problems\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% coverage is a major red flag** - No tests ran successfully. The empty coverage report suggests:\n- Tests crashed before collecting any coverage data\n- Coverage configuration may be broken\n- Test discovery failed completely\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Psycopg2 modification** - Changes to database driver in virtual environment suggest dependency conflicts or manual edits that broke imports\n2. **Key rotation changes** - Security-related code modifications may have introduced breaking changes\n3. **temp_pg_test.py** - Temporary test files indicate incomplete test development or debugging artifacts\n\n## Recommendations\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. Fix test execution first - check pytest/unitest configuration and dependencies\n2. Remove manual edits to `.venv` packages - use proper dependency management\n3. Clean up temporary test files from test runs\n4. Verify database connections in key_rotation tests aren't causing fatal errors\n\n**Short-term:**\n- Run tests with `-v` flag to see where they fail\n- Check for import errors in test modules\n- Validate psycopg2 installation and connection strings\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Cannot validate any functionality:\n- Security risks from untested key rotation logic\n- Database integration completely unverified\n- No confidence in recent changes\n- Potential production deployment risks\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
