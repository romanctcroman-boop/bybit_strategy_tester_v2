    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1), indicating fundamental issues with the test environment, dependencies, or test code structure. No meaningful quality assessment possible since tests didn't run.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**ZERO COVERAGE** - 0.00% coverage confirms no tests executed successfully. All code changes in `health_check.py` and `analyze_ide_with_edits.py` are completely untested.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Syntax/Import Errors** in modified files preventing test execution\n2. **Missing Dependencies** - New imports in changed files not available in test environment\n3. **Configuration Issues** - Test runner setup broken by recent changes\n4. **Environment Incompatibility** - Changes require specific environment setup not present\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. Run tests individually to identify which specific test fails first\n2. Check test logs/console output for stack traces and error details\n3. Verify all imports in changed files are available in test environment\n4. Ensure test configuration files (pytest.ini, requirements.txt) are updated\n\n**FOLLOW-UP:**\n- Add basic smoke tests for each changed file before comprehensive coverage\n- Implement CI pipeline that fails fast on syntax/import issues\n- Add pre-commit hooks to catch basic Python syntax errors\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Changes are completely unvalidated. Potential for:\n- Runtime crashes in production\n- Broken functionality in health monitoring and IDE analysis features\n- Cascading failures in dependent systems\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any deployment consideration.",
