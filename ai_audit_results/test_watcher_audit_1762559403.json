Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure before any tests could execute.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% coverage** - No code was executed during testing. This represents a complete testing infrastructure breakdown.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Test runner failure** - Likely caused by:\n   - Syntax errors in test files or test configuration\n   - Missing dependencies in test environment\n   - Broken test discovery mechanism\n   - Import failures in `ask_deepseek_direct.py` or test files\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Fix test execution first**:\n   - Run tests with `-v` flag to see specific failure details\n   - Check for syntax errors: `python -m py_compile ask_deepseek_direct.py`\n   - Verify test dependencies are installed\n   - Ensure test discovery is working: `python -m pytest --collect-only`\n\n2. **Debug steps**:\n   - Run a simple smoke test to verify basic functionality\n   - Check import statements in changed file\n   - Review recent changes to test configuration files\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Code is completely untested. Any defects could go undetected, potentially causing:\n- Runtime crashes in production\n- Data corruption\n- Security vulnerabilities\n- Integration failures\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
