    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test suite failed to execute (Exit Code -1). No meaningful quality assessment possible as tests didn't run. This indicates either fatal configuration issues or code that prevents test execution.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0.00% coverage** - No code was executed during testing. This is a direct result of test execution failure, not a coverage measurement issue.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe changes to `factory.py` likely contain:\n- Syntax errors preventing import/execution\n- Circular imports or module loading issues\n- Missing dependencies or imports\n- Runtime errors during module initialization\n- Test configuration/runner compatibility issues\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n1. **Immediate Action**: Fix test execution failure\n   - Check for syntax errors in `factory.py`\n   - Verify imports in both changed files\n   - Run with `python -m pytest -v` to see detailed error\n\n2. **Debug Steps**:\n   ```bash\n   python -c \"from backend.strategies.factory import *\"  # Test import\n   python -m py_compile backend/strategies/factory.py    # Check syntax\n   ```\n\n3. **Prevention**:\n   - Add pre-commit hooks with syntax checking\n   - Implement basic smoke tests for imports\n   - Use CI with fail-fast on syntax errors\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Production deployment would likely fail. The codebase is currently untestable and potentially broken. All changes should be blocked until tests execute successfully.\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution immediately before any other development continues.",
