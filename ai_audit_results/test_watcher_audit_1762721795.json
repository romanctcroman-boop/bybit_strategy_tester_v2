Exit code -1 indicates a fatal error during test execution, likely preventing any tests from running.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **0% coverage** across all files\n- No tests executed successfully\n- Complete testing blackout for distributed_cache module\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Syntax/Import Errors** in either test file or implementation\n2. **Configuration Issues** - pytest/setup configuration broken\n3. **Dependency Problems** - Missing imports or broken dependencies\n4. **Test Fixture Failures** - Global setup/teardown crashing\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Fix Test Execution First**\n   - Run tests with `-v` flag to see specific error\n   - Check for syntax errors in both changed files\n   - Verify imports and dependencies\n\n2. **Debug Priority Order**\n   - Run `python -m py_compile` on both changed files\n   - Execute minimal test: `python -m pytest tests/test_distributed_cache.py::test_simplest_case -v`\n   - Check for circular imports between modules\n\n3. **Restore Basic Testing**\n   - Add simple smoke test to verify basic functionality\n   - Ensure at least one test passes before addressing coverage\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Code changes are completely untested:\n- Production failures highly likely\n- Distributed cache reliability unknown\n- No validation of recent changes\n- Critical system component potentially broken\n\n**Action**: Stop deployment immediately until basic test execution is restored and critical path tests pass.",
