    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1). No tests ran successfully, indicating fundamental infrastructure or configuration issues rather than test logic problems.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This represents a complete testing blackout, making it impossible to assess actual code quality or functionality.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe single changed file `tests\\backend\\conftest.py` is highly suspicious:\n- Likely contains pytest configuration/fixtures that broke the entire test framework\n- Possible causes: Syntax errors, import failures, fixture conflicts, or environment setup failures\n- May have introduced circular dependencies or broken test discovery\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. **Rollback** the conftest.py changes and verify tests run\n2. **Isolate the failure** by running: `pytest tests/backend/conftest.py -v`\n3. **Check syntax**: `python -m py_compile tests/backend/conftest.py`\n4. **Validate imports** and fixture dependencies\n\n**FOLLOW-UP:**\n- Add pre-commit hooks to validate pytest configuration\n- Implement basic smoke tests for test infrastructure\n- Consider splitting complex conftest files\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deploying without test validation exposes the system to:\n- Undetected regressions and bugs\n- Potential production failures\n- Security vulnerabilities going unnoticed\n- Complete loss of quality assurance capability\n\n**Priority:** Fix test infrastructure immediately before any further development or deployment.",
