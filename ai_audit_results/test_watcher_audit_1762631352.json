No tests ran successfully, indicating either catastrophic test infrastructure issues or severe code defects preventing test execution.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% coverage** - All files show 0% coverage because no tests executed. This represents maximum coverage gap - we have no visibility into code quality or functionality.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe failure likely stems from `di_container.py` changes:\n- **Dependency injection container broken** - Likely causing import/circular dependency issues\n- **Service initialization failures** - Container unable to instantiate required services\n- **Configuration/registration errors** - Missing or misconfigured service bindings\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n1. **Immediate Priority**: Fix DI container to enable test execution\n   - Check for circular imports in `di_container.py`\n   - Verify all service registrations are valid\n   - Ensure no missing dependencies\n\n2. **Test Infrastructure**:\n   - Add basic smoke test to verify DI container builds successfully\n   - Implement container validation in test setup\n\n3. **Progressive Recovery**:\n   - Fix container → Run unit tests → Measure actual coverage → Address gaps\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Production deployment would likely fail completely. Without working tests, we cannot validate:\n- Basic functionality\n- Integration points\n- Error handling\n- Any recent feature changes\n\n**Priority**: Fix DI container immediately before any further development or deployment.",
