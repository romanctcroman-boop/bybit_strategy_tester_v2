    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely unhandled exception or environment crash). Zero coverage confirms no tests executed successfully.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **100% coverage gap** - No code was executed during testing\n- Both modified files (`sandbox_executor.py`, `rate_limiter.py`) have unknown impact\n- Entire test suite is effectively useless in current state\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Sandbox executor** likely introduced fatal errors (security/sandbox code often causes environment crashes)\n2. **Rate limiter changes** may have broken import chains or initialization\n3. Possible circular imports or dependency conflicts between these modules\n4. Environment configuration may be incompatible with new code\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Fix test execution first** - Run tests with `-v` flag to see which test crashes first\n2. **Isolate the crash** - Temporarily remove both changed files to confirm they're the cause\n3. **Check imports** - Verify no circular dependencies between security and middleware modules\n4. **Add basic smoke tests** - Create minimal tests that validate module loading before complex logic\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deploying this code would be extremely dangerous:\n- Zero test validation means potential security vulnerabilities in sandbox code\n- Rate limiting could be completely broken\n- No safety net for future changes\n- Critical functionality (security + rate limiting) is completely untested\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any other development.",
