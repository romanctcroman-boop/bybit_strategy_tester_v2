    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1). No tests ran successfully, indicating fundamental infrastructure or configuration issues rather than test logic problems.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This represents a complete testing blackout, making all production code untested and unreliable.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe single changed file `tests\\backend\\conftest.py` is highly suspicious:\n- **Pytest configuration corruption** - Likely contains syntax errors, import failures, or fixture definition errors\n- **Plugin conflicts** - Recent changes may have broken pytest plugin integrations\n- **Environment setup failures** - Database connections, API mocks, or test data initialization may be failing\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. **Rollback** the conftest.py changes and verify tests pass\n2. **Isolate the failure** by running: `pytest tests/backend/conftest.py -v`\n3. **Check syntax** with: `python -m py_compile tests/backend/conftest.py`\n4. **Review recent changes** to conftest.py for obvious errors (missing imports, syntax issues)\n\n**FOLLOW-UP:**\n- Add pre-commit hooks to validate pytest configuration\n- Implement basic smoke tests that run before full test suite\n- Consider splitting complex conftest.py into smaller, focused modules\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - All code changes are effectively untested. Deployment in this state could lead to:\n- Production outages from undetected bugs\n- Data corruption from broken database interactions\n- Security vulnerabilities from untested authentication flows\n\n**Priority:** Fix immediately before any further development or deployments.",
