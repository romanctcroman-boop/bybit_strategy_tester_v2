Implement staged testing (unit → integration → E2E)\n2. Add test environment validation at startup\n3. Create smoke tests to verify test infrastructure\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state provides zero confidence in code quality:\n- No reliable test feedback\n- Potential production issues undetectable\n- Development blocked until resolved\n- Integration testing completely broken\n\n**Priority**: Resolve immediately before any further development or deployments.",
