    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates a fatal error during test execution, likely preventing any tests from running.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% coverage is a major red flag** - No code is being executed during testing. This suggests:\n- Test infrastructure failure\n- Import/syntax errors in test files\n- Environment configuration issues\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Broken imports** between `tests\\test_request_deduplication.py` and `reliability\\request_deduplication.py`\n2. **Syntax errors** in either test or implementation files\n3. **Missing dependencies** or environment setup\n4. **Test runner configuration** issues\n\n## Immediate Actions Required\n1. **Fix test execution first**:\n   - Check Python syntax in both changed files\n   - Verify imports work correctly\n   - Run tests with `-v` flag to see specific errors\n   - Ensure test discovery is working\n\n2. **Validate basic functionality**:\n   ```bash\n   python -m py_compile reliability/request_deduplication.py\n   python -c \"from reliability import request_deduplication\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Add smoke test** to verify the module can be imported and basic functions work\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Shipping code with 0% test coverage and broken test execution is extremely dangerous. The deduplication functionality is likely completely untested and may contain critical bugs affecting system reliability.\n\n## Priority Recommendations\n1. **Fix test execution immediately** - this is blocking all quality checks\n2. **Add basic unit tests** covering core deduplication logic\n3. **Implement integration tests** for request flow\n4. **Set up CI gate** to prevent merges with broken tests\n\n**Start by identifying why tests won't run - this is the most urgent issue.**",
