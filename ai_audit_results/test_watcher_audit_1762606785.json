    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1), indicating fundamental issues with the test environment, dependencies, or code structure. Zero coverage suggests tests didn't even start executing properly.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **Total Coverage: 0.00%** - No code was executed during testing\n- **No file-specific coverage data** - Tests failed before any meaningful execution\n- **Critical gap**: Unable to assess actual code coverage due to test infrastructure failure\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Dependency conflicts** - Recent changes to perplexity_client.py or server.py may have broken imports\n2. **Configuration issues** - Environment variables, API keys, or paths missing\n3. **Syntax/runtime errors** - Files may contain code that prevents test execution\n4. **Integration failures** - Changes in one module breaking dependent modules\n\n## Immediate Action Recommendations\n1. **Fix test execution first**:\n   - Check Python environment and dependencies\n   - Verify all required packages are installed\n   - Run tests with `-v` flag to see where they fail\n   - Test individual files to isolate the breaking change\n\n2. **Debug specific files**:\n   - Test `perplexity_client.py` independently for API integration issues\n   - Verify `server.py` starts without errors\n   - Check `analyze_perplexity_architecture.py` for import/syntax issues\n\n3. **Infrastructure fixes**:\n   - Ensure test runner configuration is correct\n   - Verify all environment variables are set\n   - Check file paths and module imports\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- Production deployment would likely fail\n- No validation of recent code changes\n- Potential for undetected bugs in core functionality\n- Broken integration between modules\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
