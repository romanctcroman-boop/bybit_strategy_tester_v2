    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests didn't execute properly (Exit Code -1 indicates abnormal termination). Test infrastructure appears broken rather than tests simply failing.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0.00% coverage** - No code was executed during testing. This suggests either:\n- Test runner configuration issues\n- Import failures preventing test discovery\n- Environment/dependency problems\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe changed files suggest potential problems:\n- **`shared_circuit_breaker.py`**: Likely contains import dependencies or initialization code that's failing\n- **`__init__.py`**: Could have broken module imports or package structure\n\n## Recommendations\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. Check test runner logs for specific error messages\n2. Verify imports in `shared_circuit_breaker.py` aren't circular or missing\n3. Test module imports manually: `python -c \"from backend.api import shared_circuit_breaker\"`\n\n**Short-term:**\n- Add basic smoke tests to verify module loading\n- Check for uncaught exceptions in circuit breaker initialization\n- Validate Python path and package structure\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deployment would be blind with 0% test coverage. The exit code -1 suggests system-level issues that could affect production runtime.\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution before any further development or deployment.",
