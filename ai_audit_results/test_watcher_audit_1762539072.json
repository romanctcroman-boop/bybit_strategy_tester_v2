    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates a fatal error before any tests could execute. This represents a complete breakdown in test infrastructure.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This is not a coverage gap but a complete test execution failure.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Modified dependency file** (`watchdog/events.py`) suggests dependency conflicts or version incompatibility\n2. **Integration test changes** may have introduced fatal configuration errors\n3. Possible environment corruption in virtual environment (`.venv`)\n\n## Immediate Action Recommendations\n1. **Investigate test runner configuration** - Check pytest/runner setup and environment variables\n2. **Verify dependency integrity** - Restore original `watchdog` package and test\n3. **Check virtual environment** - Recreate `.venv` and reinstall dependencies\n4. **Run minimal test** - Execute a single simple test to isolate the failure point\n5. **Review recent commits** - Identify what changed in test configuration or dependencies\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - No test feedback means undetected production issues are likely. Code changes cannot be safely deployed until resolved.\n\n**Priority: Fix immediately** - This blocks all development and deployment activities.",
