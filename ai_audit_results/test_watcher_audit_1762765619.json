    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely unhandled exception or system error). No tests executed successfully.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This represents complete test suite failure, not just poor coverage.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **auto_diagnostic_system.py changes likely broke test infrastructure**\n2. Possible causes:\n   - Syntax errors preventing test discovery/import\n   - Module initialization crashes\n   - Missing dependencies in test environment\n   - Test runner configuration broken\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Fix test execution first** - Run tests with verbose output to identify crash cause\n2. Check for:\n   - Import errors in auto_diagnostic_system.py\n   - Missing `__init__.py` files\n   - Syntax errors or runtime exceptions on module load\n3. Add basic smoke test to verify module can be imported\n4. Once tests run, establish baseline coverage >80%\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Code is completely untested. Any changes are deploying blind. Production failures are highly probable.\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development.",
