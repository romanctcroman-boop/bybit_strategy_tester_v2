    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional:\n- Exit code -1 indicates abnormal termination (segmentation fault, memory error, or fatal Python error)\n- 0% coverage suggests tests never executed properly\n- Likely environment or dependency issues preventing test execution\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**NO COVERAGE DATA AVAILABLE** - This is more severe than low coverage:\n- Tests cannot run to collect any coverage data\n- All code changes are completely untested\n- Impossible to assess what functionality is actually working\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Prometheus exporter changes** likely introduced fatal errors:\n   - C-level extensions crashing (exit code -1)\n   - Memory management issues in metrics collection\n   - Dependency conflicts with prometheus_client\n\n2. **Test infrastructure broken**:\n   - Import errors in test modules\n   - Environment configuration issues\n   - Missing dependencies in test environment\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n1. Run tests with `-v` flag to see which test fails first\n2. Check Python version compatibility\n3. Verify prometheus_client dependency version\n4. Run individual test files to isolate the crash\n\n**STRUCTURAL FIXES:**\n1. Add basic smoke tests that run before full test suite\n2. Implement dependency version pinning\n3. Set up isolated test environment\n4. Add logging to identify crash location\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Production deployment should be blocked:\n- Critical functionality may be completely broken\n- No validation that metrics export works\n- Potential for silent failures in monitoring system\n- Could impact production monitoring and alerting\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
