    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1). No meaningful test quality can be assessed since tests didn't run successfully. This indicates fundamental issues with the test environment, dependencies, or test code structure.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**ZERO COVERAGE** - 0.00% coverage confirms no code was executed. All test scenarios, edge cases, and business logic remain completely untested.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **File `full_ai_audit_deepseek_perplexity_deepseek.py` likely contains:**\n   - Syntax errors preventing import/execution\n   - Missing dependencies or imports\n   - Runtime errors during module loading\n   - Configuration issues in test setup\n\n## Immediate Action Recommendations\n1. **Debug Test Execution:**\n   - Run tests with verbose output to identify the specific failure point\n   - Check for syntax errors: `python -m py_compile full_ai_audit_deepseek_perplexity_deepseek.py`\n   - Verify all imports and dependencies are available\n\n2. **Fix Foundation First:**\n   - Ensure basic test setup runs without errors\n   - Add simple smoke tests before comprehensive coverage\n   - Validate test configuration and environment\n\n3. **Implement Progressive Testing:**\n   - Start with unit tests for individual functions\n   - Add integration tests once basics work\n   - Gradually build toward full coverage\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Deploying untested code poses severe risks:\n- Runtime failures in production\n- Undetected logical errors\n- Potential data corruption\n- Security vulnerabilities\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
