No tests ran successfully, indicating either:\n- Syntax errors in test files or code\n- Missing dependencies/environment setup\n- Test framework configuration issues\n- Fatal errors during test discovery/import\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This is a direct result of test execution failure, not a coverage measurement issue.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe failure likely relates to `reliability\\deepseek_client.py` changes:\n- Import errors or circular dependencies\n- Syntax errors (Python 3.x compatibility issues)\n- Missing required modules/packages\n- Breaking changes to class/method signatures\n- Environment-specific dependencies not available in test environment\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. **Fix Test Execution First**\n   - Run tests with `-v` flag to see specific failure points\n   - Check Python version compatibility\n   - Verify all dependencies are installed in test environment\n\n2. **Validate `deepseek_client.py`**\n   - Run `python -m py_compile reliability\\deepseek_client.py`\n   - Check for import statements and dependency availability\n   - Test basic import: `from reliability.deepseek_client import *`\n\n3. **Infrastructure Check**\n   - Verify test runner configuration\n   - Check environment variables and paths\n   - Ensure test discovery patterns are correct\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- No functional verification of recent changes\n- Potential production-breaking issues undetected\n- Complete loss of test safety net\n- Urgent attention required before any deployment\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before addressing coverage or adding new tests.",
