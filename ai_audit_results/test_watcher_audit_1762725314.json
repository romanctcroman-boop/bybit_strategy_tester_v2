    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1). No meaningful test quality assessment possible as tests didn't run to completion. This indicates either catastrophic test infrastructure issues or severe code defects preventing test execution.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0.00% coverage** - No code was executed during testing. This represents a complete testing failure, not just poor coverage.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe single changed file (`mcp-server\\reliable_mcp_server.py`) likely contains:\n- Syntax errors preventing import/execution\n- Fatal runtime errors during module initialization\n- Missing dependencies or imports\n- Infinite loops or blocking operations during import\n\n## Recommendations\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. **Fix test execution first** - Run tests with verbose output to identify why they're failing to start\n2. **Check syntax** - Validate `reliable_mcp_server.py` for basic Python syntax compliance\n3. **Test imports** - Verify the module can be imported without errors\n4. **Add basic smoke test** - Create a minimal test that imports and instantiates core components\n\n**Secondary Actions:**\n5. Implement CI pipeline that fails fast on syntax/import issues\n6. Add static analysis (pylint, mypy) to catch issues before test execution\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Production deployment would be extremely risky:\n- Zero test verification of recent changes\n- Unknown if basic functionality works\n- Potential for runtime crashes in production\n- No regression protection for existing features\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
