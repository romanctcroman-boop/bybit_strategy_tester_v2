    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1). No meaningful quality assessment possible as tests didn't run to completion. This indicates either catastrophic test infrastructure issues or severe code defects preventing test execution.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% COVERAGE** - No code was executed during testing. This represents the worst-case scenario for test coverage, indicating:\n- Tests may be completely broken or misconfigured\n- Test environment setup failures\n- Possible import/circular dependency issues\n- Test runner configuration problems\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe failure coincides with changes to `advanced_architecture.py`, suggesting:\n- **Syntax errors** preventing module import\n- **Missing dependencies** or imports\n- **Circular imports** causing import-time failures\n- **Architectural changes** breaking test infrastructure\n- **Environment configuration** mismatches\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. **Fix test execution** - Check for syntax errors in `advanced_architecture.py`\n2. **Verify imports** - Ensure all dependencies are available in test environment\n3. **Run minimal test** - Execute a single simple test to validate basic functionality\n\n**Follow-up:**\n4. **Add smoke tests** - Create basic validation tests that run before full test suite\n5. **Improve test isolation** - Ensure tests can run independently of architectural changes\n6. **Monitor exit codes** - Set up alerts for non-zero test exits\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- **Production risk**: Untested code changes\n- **Regression risk**: No safety net for future changes\n- **Development blockage**: Cannot validate any functionality\n- **Urgency**: Requires immediate attention before further development\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution as blocking issue before any additional feature work.",
