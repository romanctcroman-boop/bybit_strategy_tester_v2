Run tests with `-v` flag to see which specific test fails first\n2. Check Python version compatibility and dependency installation\n3. Verify test file imports and module structure\n4. Add try-catch blocks around test setup to capture initialization errors\n\n**Short-term:**\n1. Create a minimal passing test to verify basic functionality\n2. Add logging to identify where execution fails\n3. Implement test isolation to prevent cascading failures\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- Production code changes cannot be validated\n- Regression risk is extremely high\n- Deployment would be unsafe\n- Backtesting engine functionality is unverified\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution before any further development or deployment.",
