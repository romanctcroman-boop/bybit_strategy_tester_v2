    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates a fatal error before any tests could execute. This represents a complete breakdown in test infrastructure.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0.00% coverage** - No code was executed during testing. This is not a coverage gap but a complete test execution failure.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Integration test files** (`load_api_keys.py`, `test_real_api_integration.py`) likely contain:\n   - Fatal import errors or syntax issues\n   - Missing dependencies or environment setup\n   - Infinite loops or blocking operations\n   - Configuration errors preventing test discovery\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Debug test discovery**: Run `python -m pytest --collect-only` to identify why tests aren't loading\n2. **Check imports**: Verify all imports in the changed integration test files\n3. **Validate environment**: Ensure required API keys and external dependencies are available\n4. **Isolate the failure**: Test each changed file individually to identify the breaking change\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - No test feedback means undetected regressions could be deployed. The entire test suite is compromised until this is resolved.\n\n**Priority Action**: Fix the test execution failure before any other development continues. Without working tests, code quality cannot be verified.",
