    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional. Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely unhandled exception or environment crash). No tests executed successfully.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**0% coverage** - All code paths are untested. Critical gaps:\n- No unit tests executed for `mcp-server/server.py`\n- No integration tests running\n- Entire codebase is effectively untested\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nRecent changes to `mcp-server/server.py` likely caused:\n- **Syntax errors** preventing test execution\n- **Import/circular dependency** issues\n- **Missing dependencies** or environment misconfiguration\n- **Critical runtime exceptions** during test setup\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. Fix test execution environment - check Python version, dependencies, imports\n2. Add basic smoke test to verify server starts without crashing\n3. Fix syntax/import errors in `server.py` preventing test execution\n\n**Short-term:**\n1. Implement minimal unit tests for core server functionality\n2. Add test coverage reporting to CI pipeline\n3. Set up proper test fixtures and mocking\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Production deployment would be extremely dangerous:\n- Zero test coverage means undetected bugs are guaranteed\n- Recent changes likely introduced breaking changes\n- No regression protection for future changes\n- High probability of runtime failures in production\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development.",
