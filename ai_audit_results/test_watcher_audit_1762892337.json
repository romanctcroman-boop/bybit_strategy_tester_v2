    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1). No meaningful testing occurred. This indicates either:\n- Syntax errors in test code or implementation\n- Critical runtime failures during test setup\n- Missing dependencies or configuration issues\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0% coverage** - All tests failed before any code execution could be measured. No coverage data was collected.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe cache_manager.py modification likely introduced:\n- **Syntax errors** (missing imports, invalid Python)\n- **Import/circular dependency issues**\n- **Configuration breaking changes** affecting test initialization\n- **Critical exceptions** during module import\n\n## Recommendations\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. **Fix test execution first** - Check test runner logs for the specific error causing exit code -1\n2. **Verify cache_manager.py syntax** - Run `python -m py_compile backend/cache/cache_manager.py`\n3. **Check imports** - Ensure all dependencies are available in test environment\n4. **Run tests individually** to isolate the failing component\n\n**Follow-up:**\n5. Add basic smoke tests that validate module imports before comprehensive testing\n6. Implement CI checks for syntax validation pre-commit\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Production deployment would likely fail completely. The cache system is likely non-functional, which could:\n- Crash dependent services\n- Cause data consistency issues\n- Impact application performance severely\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately - this blocks all other quality assessments.",
