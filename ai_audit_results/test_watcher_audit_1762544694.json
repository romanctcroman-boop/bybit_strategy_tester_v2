    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Tests are completely non-functional:\n- Exit code -1 indicates catastrophic failure (likely uncaught exception during test setup/import)\n- 0% coverage suggests tests aren't even executing\n- This represents a complete breakdown of the testing pipeline\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n**Total System Failure** - No coverage data available indicates:\n- Test environment cannot initialize\n- Critical dependencies missing or misconfigured  \n- Possible circular imports or module loading issues\n- Database/API connections failing during test bootstrap\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n**High Risk Changes Detected:**\n1. **`backend/ml/lstm_queue_predictor.py`** - New ML component likely has missing dependencies\n2. **`backend/core/mtf_engine.py`** - Core engine modifications may have broken imports\n3. **`tests/backend/conftest.py`** - Test configuration changes probably introduced breaking changes\n4. **Multiple new API test files** - Suggest significant architecture changes without proper test isolation\n\n## Immediate Action Recommendations\n\n**🟥 CRITICAL (Fix within 1 hour):**\n1. Check `tests/backend/conftest.py` for recent changes - this is likely the root cause\n2. Run tests with `-v` flag to see where initialization fails\n3. Verify all new dependencies in `requirements.txt` are installed\n\n**🟨 HIGH PRIORITY (Today):**\n1. Isolate the failure: Run tests file-by-file starting with simplest unit tests\n2. Check database connections and mock configurations\n3. Validate import chains - particularly for new ML and core engine modules\n\n**🟩 MEDIUM PRIORITY (This week):**\n1. Add test suite health checks to CI pipeline\n2. Implement dependency validation in test setup\n3. Create isolated test environments for ML components\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**SEVERE RISK** - Deployment should be blocked immediately:\n- **Code Quality Risk:** High - No validation of recent changes\n- **Regression Risk:** Critical - All functionality unverified\n- **Business Risk:** Severe - Core trading engine and ML predictions untested\n- **Recommended Action:** Halt all deployments until basic test execution is restored\n\n**First debug command:** `pytest tests/ -v --tb=short` to identify the specific failure point.",
