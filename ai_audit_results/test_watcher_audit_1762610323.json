    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test suite failed to execute (Exit Code -1). No meaningful quality assessment possible as tests didn't run. This indicates either fatal configuration issues or severe code defects preventing test initialization.\n\n## Coverage Analysis\n**0.00% coverage** - No code was executed during testing. This is a direct result of the test execution failure, not an actual coverage measurement.\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\nThe failure likely stems from changes in `mcp-server\\api\\providers\\perplexity.py`:\n- **Syntax errors** preventing module import\n- **Missing dependencies** or imports\n- **Runtime exceptions** during module loading\n- **Configuration issues** in test setup/teardown\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. **Fix test execution** - Check for syntax errors in perplexity.py\n2. **Verify imports** - Ensure all dependencies are available\n3. **Run isolated test** - Test perplexity.py module directly to identify loading issues\n4. **Check test configuration** - Review pytest configuration and conftest files\n\n**Follow-up:**\n5. Once tests execute, establish baseline coverage\n6. Add unit tests specifically for perplexity.py functionality\n7. Implement CI checks to prevent zero-coverage commits\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Production deployment would be extremely risky:\n- No validation of recent changes\n- Unknown if core functionality is broken\n- Potential for runtime failures in production\n- Complete lack of quality assurance\n\n**Priority:** Fix test execution immediately before any further development or deployment.",
