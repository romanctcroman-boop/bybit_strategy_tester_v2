    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code: -1) with 0% coverage. The test suite is non-functional and provides zero quality assurance.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **Total coverage: 0.00%** - No code is being tested\n- **Critical gap**: Tests cannot execute at all, making coverage metrics meaningless\n- **Root cause**: Likely a fatal error during test setup/import phase\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Broken imports/dependencies** in modified files (especially `backend\\core\\mtf_engine.py` or `tests\\backend\\conftest.py`)\n2. **Configuration errors** in test infrastructure\n3. **Missing dependencies** or environment setup issues\n4. **Syntax errors** in recently modified Python files\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Fix test execution first**:\n   - Run `python -m pytest tests/ -v` to identify the specific failure point\n   - Check for import errors in modified files\n   - Verify `conftest.py` doesn't have syntax/import issues\n\n2. **Priority debugging order**:\n   - Start with `tests\\backend\\conftest.py` (test configuration)\n   - Then `backend\\core\\mtf_engine.py` (core component)\n   - Finally integration tests (`test_sandbox_integration.py`)\n\n3. **Add basic smoke test** to verify test infrastructure works before complex tests\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - No test feedback means:\n- Undetected breaking changes in production code\n- No validation of recent modifications to core engine\n- Potential deployment of completely broken code\n- All reliability and edge case testing is ineffective\n\n**Action**: Stop all feature development until test infrastructure is restored. This should be treated as a blocking issue.",
