    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1) with zero coverage. This indicates either a catastrophic test infrastructure failure or severe code defects preventing test execution.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **Total Coverage: 0.00%** - No code was executed during testing\n- **No coverage data available** - Test runner failed before collecting any metrics\n- **Critical gap**: Unable to assess actual code coverage due to execution failure\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Integration test failure** in `test_multi_key_rotation.py` likely contains:\n   - Syntax errors or import failures\n   - Environment/dependency issues\n   - Infinite loops or resource exhaustion\n   - Configuration problems with test fixtures\n\n2. **Recent file changes** suggest the multi-key rotation feature introduced breaking changes\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. Run `test_multi_key_rotation.py` in isolation with verbose output\n2. Check test dependencies and environment setup\n3. Add try-catch blocks with detailed error logging in the failing test\n4. Verify test fixtures and setup/teardown methods\n\n**Short-term:**\n1. Implement test segmentation to prevent single test failures from blocking entire suite\n2. Add pre-commit hooks for basic syntax validation\n3. Create smoke tests that run before full integration suite\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Production deployment should be blocked until:\n- Root cause of test failure is identified and resolved\n- Basic test execution is restored\n- Minimum test coverage threshold is met\n\n**Critical risks:** Undetected regressions, potential security issues in key rotation logic, deployment failures.",
