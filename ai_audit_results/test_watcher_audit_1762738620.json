    "analysis": "## Test Quality Assessment\n**CRITICAL FAILURE** - Test execution failed completely (Exit Code -1) with 0% coverage, indicating fundamental issues in the test environment or codebase.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **Total failure**: 0% coverage across all files\n- **Critical gap**: Tests aren't even starting execution\n- **Missing**: No coverage data available due to test execution failure\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Test infrastructure failure** - Likely issues in `tests/backend/conftest.py` or test dependencies\n2. **Import/circular dependency problems** - Changes in `backend/core/mtf_engine.py` may have broken imports\n3. **Environment configuration** - Missing dependencies or environment variables\n4. **Test discovery issues** - Modified test files may have syntax errors or broken fixtures\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. Run tests individually to identify which specific test/file is causing the failure\n2. Check `tests/backend/conftest.py` for recent changes that may break test setup\n3. Verify all imports in modified files still resolve correctly\n4. Run with `-v` flag to see which test fails first\n\n**Short-term:**\n1. Add basic smoke tests to verify test infrastructure works\n2. Implement CI pipeline that fails fast on configuration issues\n3. Add test logging to capture initialization failures\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - The entire test suite is non-functional, meaning:\n- No regression protection for recent changes\n- Potential production-breaking issues undetected\n- All modified files (including core engine) are untested\n- Urgent fix required before further development\n\n**Priority**: Fix test execution immediately before any additional code changes.",
