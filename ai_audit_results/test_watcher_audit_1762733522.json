The test suite is non-functional and provides zero quality assurance.\n\n## Coverage Analysis & Gaps\n- **Total coverage: 0%** - No code is being tested\n- **No coverage data available** - Tests aren't even reaching execution phase\n- **Complete testing gap** - Entire codebase is untested\n\n## Potential Issues with Recent Changes\n1. **Test file `test_perplexity_client.py` is likely broken** - Syntax errors, import failures, or configuration issues\n2. **Dependency problems** - Missing imports or broken dependencies\n3. **Environment setup failure** - Test runner cannot initialize\n4. **Fixtures/configuration broken** - Setup/teardown failures preventing test execution\n\n## Immediate Recommendations\n1. **Fix test execution first**:\n   - Check for syntax errors in `test_perplexity_client.py`\n   - Verify imports and dependencies\n   - Run with `-v` flag to see specific failure details\n   - Check test configuration and fixtures\n\n2. **Restore basic functionality**:\n   - Get at least one test passing\n   - Achieve minimal coverage (>70%)\n   - Fix any broken assertions or mock setups\n\n3. **Implement safety nets**:\n   - Add pre-commit hooks to catch syntax errors\n   - Set up CI to fail fast on test execution issues\n   - Add smoke tests to verify test suite functionality\n\n## Risk Assessment\n**HIGH RISK** - Current state indicates:\n- No regression protection\n- High probability of undetected bugs in production\n- Development team working without safety nets\n- Potential for critical failures in production code\n\n**Priority: IMMEDIATE** - Fix test execution before any further development or deployment.",
