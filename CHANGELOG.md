## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Strategy Builder Canvas — 7 Coordinate & Performance Bug Fixes (2026-02-21):**
    - **BUG#1 🔴 (Drag at zoom!=1):** `startDragBlock()` now computes `dragOffset` in **logical** coordinates: `(clientX - containerRect.left) / zoom - blockData.x`. `onMouseMove` converts mouse position to logical via `/ zoom` before writing `blockData.x/y` and `block.style.left/top`. Fixes block drifting/jumping at any zoom level other than 1.
    - **BUG#2 🔴 (Marquee selection at zoom!=1):** `startMarqueeSelection()` converts `marqueeStart` to logical space (`/ zoom`). `onMouseMove` converts `currentX/Y` the same way. Marquee rect and block bounds are now both in logical space — intersection test is correct.
    - **BUG#3 🔴 (Drop position at zoom!=1):** `onCanvasDrop()` divides drop offset by `zoom` before passing to `addBlockToCanvas()`. Dropped blocks now land under the cursor at all zoom levels.
    - **BUG#4 🟡 (Double renderConnections):** Removed the standalone `renderConnections()` call from `deleteConnection()` (called just before `renderBlocks()` which already calls it internally). Same redundant call removed from `restoreStateSnapshot()`.
    - **BUG#5 🟡 (pushUndo on bare click):** Moved `pushUndo()` from `mousedown` to first real movement inside `onMouseMove` (guarded by `Math.hypot(dx, dy) > 3`). Clicks without dragging no longer pollute the undo stack.
    - **BUG#6 🟡 (console.log in render hot path):** Removed `console.log` from `renderBlocks()` (called ~60fps during drag via RAF) and stripped 5 verbose logs from `addBlockToCanvas()`. The one user-facing drop log is kept.
    - **BUG#7 🟢 (ID collision on fast generation):** All `block_${Date.now()}` and `conn_${Date.now()}` ID sites (4 block sites, 2 conn sites) now append a 5-char random suffix: `_${Math.random().toString(36).slice(2,7)}`. Prevents ID collisions during AI bulk-generation or rapid duplication.

- **Strategy Builder — 6 Bug Fixes (2026-02-21):**
    - **Bug #2 (use_fallback silent zero-signal):** `strategy_builder_adapter.py` now sets `use_fallback=True` with a diagnostic `logger.warning` when connections exist to the main node but all signal series are empty — prevents silently returning 0 trades when a node is wired but produces no signals.
    - **Bug #3 (Breakeven not passed from static_sltp):** `extractSlTpFromBlocks()` in `strategy_builder.js` already correctly extracts and forwards `breakeven_enabled`, `breakeven_activation_pct`, `breakeven_offset`, `close_only_in_profit`, `sl_type` from `static_sltp` blocks. Backend router reads these fields directly from saved `db_strategy.builder_blocks` — confirmed working end-to-end.
    - **Bug #4 (Direction filter change not saved):** Added `autoSaveStrategy()` call after `connections.splice()` in the direction-change handler so DB is updated when connections to hidden ports are pruned.
    - **Bug #5 (Mismatch highlighting misses bullish/bearish):** Mismatch detection now recognises `bullish` as alias for `long` and `bearish` as alias for `short` in source port checking, fixing highlight for divergence blocks.
    - **Bug #6 (Default port "value" causes signal loss):** `_parse_source_port()` and `_parse_target_port()` in `strategy_builder_adapter.py` now default to `""` instead of `"value"`, preventing phantom "value" port IDs that silently broke signal routing on malformed/unconnected nodes.

- **leverageManager.js — Encoding fix (2026-02-21):** All 12 Russian strings were corrupted with UTF-8 mojibake (box-drawing chars). Restored correct Cyrillic text for 8 risk level labels, 3 warning messages, and `indicator.title`. Version bumped to 1.1.1.

- **Close by Time node — Parameter labels (2026-02-21):** Added `close_by_time` block schema to `blockParamDefs` in `strategy_builder.js` with correct labels ("Use Close By Time Since Order?", "Close order after XX bars:", "Close only with Profit?", "Min Profit percent for Close. %%"). Fixed `min_profit_percent` default from `0` to `0.5`.

### Fixed

- **Perplexity cache `invalidate_cache()` TypeError on tuple keys — 2026-02-20:**
    - `backend/agents/consensus/perplexity_integration.py` line 673: `key.startswith()` failed when cache contained tuple keys `("SYMBOL", "strategy")`. Fixed to handle both `str` and `tuple` key formats.
    - 17/17 perplexity tests pass.

### Added

- **P5.1a: Agent Memory SQLite WAL backend — 2026-02-21:**
    - `AgentMemoryManager` now supports dual backend: SQLite WAL (`AGENT_MEMORY_BACKEND=sqlite`) or JSON files (default)
    - Separate database at `data/agent_conversations.db` with WAL mode for concurrent reads
    - New methods: `_init_sqlite()`, `_get_sqlite()`, `_persist_conversation_sqlite()`, `_load_conversation_sqlite()`, `_clear_conversation_sqlite()`
    - 12 unit tests including concurrent write stress test (5 threads x 20 messages)

- **P5.1b: Redis distributed lock for pipeline — 2026-02-21:**
    - `backend/services/distributed_lock.py`: `DistributedLock` with Redis SET NX EX pattern
    - Graceful fallback to `asyncio.Lock` when Redis unavailable
    - Integrated into `ai_pipeline.py` `generate_strategy` endpoint with 429 on lock timeout
    - Extracted `_execute_pipeline()` helper for clean separation
    - 8 unit tests covering acquire/release, contention, timeout, fallback

- **P5.3a: Comprehensive metrics calculator tests — 2026-02-21:**
    - 147 known-value unit tests for `backend/core/metrics_calculator.py` (86% coverage)
    - Tests every standalone function: `safe_divide`, `calculate_win_rate`, `calculate_profit_factor`, `calculate_margin_efficiency`, `calculate_ulcer_index`, `calculate_sharpe`, `calculate_sortino`, `calculate_calmar`, `calculate_max_drawdown`, `calculate_cagr`, `calculate_expectancy`, `calculate_consecutive_streaks`, `calculate_stability_r2`, `calculate_sqn`
    - Tests `calculate_trade_metrics`, `calculate_risk_metrics`, `calculate_long_short_metrics` with hand-calculated expected values
    - Tests `calculate_all()` output: 90+ keys present, all values finite, caching, Kelly criterion, expectancy
    - Tests `enrich_metrics_with_percentages`, Numba parity, edge cases (single trade, all winners, all losers, breakeven only, large PnL, negative equity)
    - Full output key verification: all documented metric keys present in result dict

- **P5.3d: XSS E2E protection tests — 2026-02-21:**
    - 98 tests without Playwright dependency (httpx AsyncClient against FastAPI app)
    - `escapeHtml` parity with `Sanitizer.js` (19 OWASP payloads, angle bracket verification, stdlib parity)
    - XSS detection patterns (dangerous tags, event handler attributes, no false positives)
    - API endpoint reflection tests (health, klines, backtest, 404 path)
    - Security headers verification (X-Content-Type-Options, server header, JSON content-type)
    - Template injection payloads (Jinja2, JS, Ruby, ERB)
    - Sanitizer.js allowed/dangerous tag verification, input length limits, null byte injection

### Fixed

- **P1 Critical Bug Fixes — 2026-02-20:**
    - **M1: Duplicate dataclass fields** — `long_largest_loss` and `short_largest_loss` were each defined twice in `BacktestMetrics` dataclass (`backend/core/metrics_calculator.py`). Second definition silently overwrote the first, causing data loss during serialization. Removed duplicate lines.
    - **M2: FK type mismatch** — `Optimization.strategy_id` was `Column(Integer)` but `strategies.id` is `Column(String(36))` (UUID). FK constraint never enforced, cascade delete broken. Changed to `Column(String(36))` in `backend/database/models/optimization.py`.
    - **F1/F2/F5/F6: XSS in strategy_builder.js** — `e.message` and `err.message` from errors/API responses were inserted via `innerHTML` without escaping. Applied `escapeHtml()` (already available in file) to all vulnerable locations: backend connection banner, database panel error, data sync status error message, and version history error.
    - **F4: Race condition in agent_memory.py** — Concurrent `store_message()` calls wrote to the same JSON file without locking, causing data corruption. Added per-conversation `threading.Lock` with a `_locks_guard` to protect the locks dict itself.
    - **A1: Deprecated pandas API** — `reindex(ohlcv.index, method="ffill")` and `fillna(method="bfill")` in `strategy_builder_adapter.py` throw `TypeError` on pandas 2.1+. Replaced with `.reindex(ohlcv.index).ffill()` and `.bfill()`.

- **Audit findings verified as false positives:**
    - **V3: VectorBT direction_mode** — Audit claimed `mode==0` disables short (should disable long). Verified code is correct: `direction_mode=0` (long only) disables `short_entry/exit`, `direction_mode=1` (short only) disables `long_entry/exit`. Dict mapping `{"long": 0, "short": 1, "both": 2}` is consistent.
    - **V1/V2: VectorBT SL/TP clamping** — Trigger conditions and price clamping logic are correct for both LONG and SHORT positions.

### Removed

- **`strategies.html` page removed — 2026-02-19:**
    - **Deleted files:** `frontend/strategies.html` (1755 lines), `frontend/css/strategies.css`, `frontend/js/pages/strategies.js`, and `frontend/js/pages/strategies/` folder (6 sub-modules: `backtestManager.js`, `strategyCRUD.js`, `leverageManager.js`, `instrumentService.js`, `utils.js`, `index.js`)
    - **Reason:** `strategy-builder.html` is a complete superset — visual block-based strategy composition replaces the old form-based approach. All functionality (backtest, optimization, strategy CRUD, templates, versions, AI build, evaluation, database management) is available on `strategy-builder.html`
    - **Migrated shared utilities:** `leverageManager.js` and `instrumentService.js` moved to `frontend/js/shared/` since `strategy_builder.js` imports `updateLeverageRiskForElements`
    - **Updated 13 navigation links** across 10 files: `analytics-advanced.html`, `settings.html`, `risk-management.html`, `portfolio.html`, `optimization-results.html`, `ml-models.html`, `notifications.html`, `marketplace.html`, `dashboard.html` (2 links), `backtest-results.html` (2 links)
    - **Updated 3 JS references:** `marketplace.js`, `dashboard.js` (2 hotkeys: `s` and `n`)

### Added

- **Direction mismatch wire highlighting — 2026-02-19:**
    - Wires (connections) that conflict with the selected direction now turn **red and dashed** with a pulsing animation:
        - Direction = "Short" but wire goes to `entry_long`/`exit_long` → red dashed
        - Direction = "Long" but wire goes to `entry_short`/`exit_short` → red dashed
        - Source port `"long"` wired to `entry_short` (cross-wired signal) → red dashed
        - Source port `"short"` wired to `entry_long` (cross-wired signal) → red dashed
    - SVG `<title>` tooltip on hover explains the mismatch in Russian
    - Wires update instantly when the direction dropdown changes
    - **Wires also re-evaluate on ANY block param change** (`updateBlockParam()`) and on `resetBlockToDefaults()`
    - CSS class: `.direction-mismatch` with `stroke: #ef4444`, `stroke-dasharray: 10 6`, pulse animation
    - Files: `frontend/js/pages/strategy_builder.js` (`renderConnections()`, `updateBlockParam()`, `resetBlockToDefaults()`), `frontend/css/strategy_builder.css`

- **Port alias fallback in Case 2 signal routing — 2026-02-19:**
    - When a connection's `source_port` is not found in `source_outputs`, the adapter now tries alias mapping (`"long"↔"bullish"`, `"short"↔"bearish"`, `"output"↔"value"`, `"result"↔"signal"`) before falling back to single-output extraction.
    - Prevents silent signal drops when backend output keys don't match frontend port IDs.
    - Logs `logger.warning` for any connection where port cannot be resolved.
    - File: `backend/backtesting/strategy_builder_adapter.py` (Case 2 in `generate_signals()`)

- **Direction mismatch warning in backtest engine — 2026-02-19:**
    - `_run_fallback()` now logs `[DIRECTION_MISMATCH]` warning when the direction filter would drop all available signals (e.g., `direction="long"` but only `short_entries` exist, or vice versa).
    - Helps diagnose "Short gives nothing" scenarios before simulation even starts.
    - File: `backend/backtesting/engine.py`

- **Pre-backtest signal diagnostics in API — 2026-02-19:**
    - `run_backtest_from_builder()` now generates a `warnings` list before running the backtest, checking for: no signals detected, direction/signal mismatch.
    - Warnings are returned in the API response as `"warnings": [...]` field.
    - File: `backend/api/routers/strategy_builder.py`

- **Frontend warning display for backtest results — 2026-02-19:**
    - `runBacktest()` in `strategy_builder.js` now checks for `warnings` array in backtest response and shows each as a notification with `warning` type.
    - Users see actionable diagnostics like "Direction is 'long' but only short signals detected" immediately after backtest completes.
    - File: `frontend/js/pages/strategy_builder.js`

- **11 new divergence tests — 2026-02-19:**
    - `TestDivergenceSignalRouting` (4 tests): long_only, short_only, both directions, no_connections
    - `TestDivergencePortAlias` (3 tests): bullish→long alias, bearish→short alias, signal alias resolution
    - `TestDivergenceWithEngine` (4 tests): direction filtering (long/short/both trades), open position at end-of-data
    - Total: 56 divergence tests pass (6 handler + 50 AI agent).
    - File: `tests/ai_agents/test_divergence_block_ai_agents.py`

### Fixed

- **🔴 CRITICAL: Divergence block signals silently dropped — 2026-02-19:**
    - **Root cause**: Backend `_execute_divergence()` returned output keys `"bullish"` and `"bearish"`, but frontend divergence block ports are named `"long"` and `"short"`. The port alias system in `_get_block_inputs()` had no mapping between these names, so when connecting `divergence.long` → `strategy.entry_long`, the signal lookup failed silently — divergence signals were never delivered to the strategy node.
    - **Fix** (`backend/backtesting/strategy_builder_adapter.py`): `_execute_divergence()` now returns **both** `"long"`/`"short"` (matching frontend port IDs) AND `"bullish"`/`"bearish"` (backward compatibility). The `"signal"` key remains as `long | short`.
    - **Test coverage**: Added `test_returns_long_short_port_keys` to verify `"long"` and `"short"` keys exist and equal `"bullish"`/`"bearish"`. All 50 divergence tests pass (6 handler + 44 AI agent).

- **Health check UnicodeEncodeError on Windows cp1251 terminals — 2026-02-19:**
    - `main.py health` crashed with `UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\U0001f3e5'` because emoji characters in `print()` can't be encoded in cp1251.
    - **Fix** (`main.py`): Added `io.TextIOWrapper` with `encoding="utf-8", errors="replace"` for stdout/stderr when terminal encoding is not UTF-8.

- **SL/TP Request Explicitness & Investigation — 2026-02-18:**
    - **Investigation**: User reported SL not triggering on 5 candles before actual exit in trade #272 (BTCUSDT, 15m, 10x leverage)
    - **Finding**: SL **IS working correctly**. Exhaustive analysis proved:
        - Entry=70103.73, SL price=66598.55 (5% below entry)
        - Only 1 of 305 fifteen-minute bars had low (66556.6) below SL — the exit bar at 2026-02-17 15:30
        - Bar Magnifier 1m data confirmed: candle at 15:33 had low=66556.6 breaching SL
        - `exit_comment: "SL"` correctly recorded; PnL=-51% is correct (5.05% price drop × 10x leverage + fees)
        - The 5 candles user circled had lows ABOVE the SL price — visual misread on compressed chart
    - **Defensive JS fix** (`frontend/js/pages/strategy_builder.js`):
        - Added `extractSlTpFromBlocks()` function — iterates `strategyBlocks` for `static_sltp`/`sl_percent`/`tp_percent` blocks
        - Converts human % (e.g., 5) to decimal fraction (0.05) matching `BacktestRequest` model constraints
        - Spread into `buildBacktestRequest()` so `stop_loss`/`take_profit` are sent explicitly in request body
        - Backend already extracted SL/TP from DB blocks as fallback — this makes the request self-contained and debuggable

- **🔴 CRITICAL: Margin/Equity/Fee Deep Audit Fixes — 2026-02-18:**
    - **engine.py — Margin Reconstruction Error (Issue #1)**:
        - Old code reconstructed margin at exit: `margin = entry_size * entry_price / leverage`
        - This is mathematically WRONG because `entry_size = margin * leverage / (price * (1+fee))`, so `size * price / leverage ≠ margin` (fee term causes drift)
        - Fix: Track `margin_allocated` at entry, use exact value at exit
    - **engine.py — Equity Formula Inflation (Issue #2)**:
        - Old: `equity = cash + entry_price * position + unrealized_pnl` — position includes leverage, inflating equity by `(leverage - 1) * margin`
        - Fix: `equity = cash + margin_allocated + unrealized_pnl` — matches FallbackEngineV4 gold standard
    - **engine.py — Fee Recording Approximation (Issue #3)**:
        - Old: `total_trade_fees = fees * 2` — assumes entry fee == exit fee (wrong when entry_price ≠ exit_price)
        - Fix: Track `entry_fees_paid` at entry, total = `entry_fees_paid + exit_fees`
    - **engine.py — End-of-Data Close (Issue #4)**:
        - Same margin reconstruction and fee doubling bugs existed in end-of-backtest close path
        - Fixed with same `margin_allocated` / `entry_fees_paid` pattern
    - **vectorbt_sltp.py — Margin State Tracking (Issue #5)**:
        - State array expanded from 6 to 8 elements: added `margin_locked` (state[6]) and `entry_fees_paid` (state[7])
        - All 5 exit paths (max_drawdown, SL/TP long, SL/TP short, signal exit) now use tracked margin instead of reconstructed
        - Equity formula: `cash + margin_locked + unrealized_pnl` (was `cash + size * price + unrealized`)
    - **Tests**: Added 19 new tests in `tests/backend/backtesting/test_margin_fee_parity.py`:
        - Margin conservation (zero fees, across leverage levels, with fees)
        - Equity formula not inflated by leverage
        - Fee recording accuracy (exact entry+exit vs doubled)
        - No margin leak across various fee rates
        - End-of-data close margin and fee correctness
    - **Total backtesting tests: 147/147 pass** (128 existing + 19 new)

- **🔴 CRITICAL: Equity Double-Leverage Bug — 2026-02-18:**
    - **Root cause**: `engine.py` multiplied `unrealized_pnl` by `leverage` despite `position` (entry_size) already including leverage. This caused equity curve to show `leverage²` amplified unrealized PnL.
    - **Affected code**:
        - `_build_equity_with_position_tracking()`: `unrealized = (price - entry) * size * leverage` → fixed to `* size` (no `* leverage`)
        - `_run_fallback()` equity section: same double-leverage pattern, same fix
    - **Gold standard reference**: `FallbackEngineV4` uses `unrealized = total_size * (close - avg_entry)` — no extra leverage, because `total_size = (margin * leverage) / price`

- **🔴 CRITICAL: numba_engine.py Cash Model Overhaul — 2026-02-18:**
    - **Root cause**: `numba_engine.py` used a fundamentally broken cash model:
        1. `entry_size` had NO leverage: `size = margin / (price * (1+fee))` — missing `* leverage`
        2. Cash deducted full `position_value` (not margin): `cash -= position_value + fees`
        3. Long exit returned raw `position_value - fees` (no leveraged PnL in cash)
        4. Short exit was inconsistent: `cash += position_value + pnl` (different formula from Long)
        5. PnL/MFE/MAE had `* leverage` to compensate for missing leverage in size
    - **Fix**: Rewrote to match FallbackEngineV4 margin-based model:
        - Entry: `entry_size = (margin * leverage) / (price * (1+fee))` — leverage IN size
        - Cash entry: `cash -= margin + entry_fees` — deduct margin only
        - PnL: `(exit - entry) * entry_size - exit_fees` — no extra `* leverage`
        - Cash exit: `cash += margin + pnl` — return margin + net PnL (symmetric Long/Short)
        - Equity: `unrealized = (price - entry) * position` — no extra `* leverage`
        - pnl_pct: `pnl / margin * 100` — % return on margin invested
        - MFE/MAE: `(price_diff) * entry_size` — no extra `* leverage`
    - **Tests**: Added 53 new tests in `tests/backend/backtesting/test_equity_pnl_parity.py`:
        - Entry sizing formula validation (leverage scaling)
        - PnL calculation without extra leverage
        - Cash flow round-trip (profitable/losing, long/short symmetric)
        - Unrealized PnL without double leverage
        - Equity mid-trade correctness
        - MFE/MAE with leverage in size
        - Numba engine integration: entry_size, PnL scaling, equity, cash conservation
    - **Verification**: 128 backtesting tests pass (28 engine + 53 equity + 22 SL/TP + 3 GPU + 21 MTF + 1 parity), 4485 total tests pass

- **🔴 CRITICAL: SL/TP Leverage Bug — 2026-02-18:**
    - **Root cause**: `engine.py`, `numba_engine.py`, `fast_optimizer.py`, `vectorbt_sltp.py` all divided SL/TP by leverage when calculating exit prices
    - **Impact**: With SL=5% and leverage=10, SL triggered at 0.5% price movement instead of 5%. This made ALL trade PnL values uniform and incorrect.
    - **Fix**: Removed `/leverage` from exit_price formulas and `*leverage` from pnl_pct trigger checks. SL/TP now correctly represent % of price movement (TradingView semantics), matching `FallbackEngineV4` (gold standard).
    - **Files changed**:
        - `backend/backtesting/engine.py` — `_run_fallback()`: worst/best_pnl_pct, bar magnifier SL/TP, standard SL/TP exit prices
        - `backend/backtesting/numba_engine.py` — pnl_pct calculation, SL/TP exit prices
        - `backend/backtesting/fast_optimizer.py` — pnl_pct calculation, SL/TP exit prices (both functions)
        - `backend/backtesting/vectorbt_sltp.py` — removed `adjusted_sl/tp = sl_pct / leverage`, now passes raw sl_pct/tp_pct to `check_sl_tp_hit_nb()`
    - **Tests**: Added 22 new tests in `tests/backend/backtesting/test_sltp_leverage_parity.py` covering exit price independence from leverage, trigger conditions, PnL scaling, and vectorbt parity
    - **Verification**: All 92 existing engine tests pass (28 + 32 + 10 + 22 new)

### Fixed

- **Аудит панели «Критерии оценки» (Evaluation Panel) — 2026-02-09:**
    - **BUG-1 (КРИТИЧЕСКИЙ):** `optimization_panels.js` содержал хардкод symbol='BTCUSDT', interval='1h', direction='both', initial_capital=10000, leverage=10, commission=0.0007, strategy_type='rsi' — параметры из панели «Параметры» полностью игнорировались при запуске оптимизации. Добавлен метод `getPropertiesPanelValues()`, который читает 8 параметров из DOM.
    - **BUG-2 (ВЫСОКИЙ):** Функция `_passes_filters()` не вызывалась в 2 из 3 путей выполнения `sync_grid_search_optimization`: GPU batch и single-process. Constraints из Evaluation Panel (max_drawdown ≤ 15%, total_trades ≥ 50 и др.) применялись только в multiprocessing-пути. Добавлены вызовы в оба пропущенных пути.
    - **BUG-3 (СРЕДНИЙ):** 13 из 20 фронтенд-метрик не поддерживались в backend-функциях скоринга (`_calculate_composite_score`, `_rank_by_multi_criteria`, `_compute_weighted_composite`). Метрики sortino_ratio, calmar_ratio, cagr, avg_drawdown, volatility, var_95, risk_adjusted_return, avg_win, avg_loss, expectancy, payoff_ratio, trades_per_month, avg_bars_in_trade возвращали дефолтные значения. Все 3 функции расширены до 20+ метрик.
    - Документация: `docs/AUDIT_EVALUATION_PANEL.md`
    - Тесты: `tests/backend/api/test_evaluation_panel.py` — 87 тестов (скоринг, фильтрация, ранжирование, нормализация, интеграция)

- **Аудит панели «Параметры» (Properties Panel) — 2026-02-09:**
    - **BUG-1 (КРИТИЧЕСКИЙ):** `direction` из UI (long/short/both) игнорировался при запуске бэктеста — поле отсутствовало в `BacktestRequest`. Бэкенд брал direction из сохранённого `builder_graph`, что приводило к рассогласованию UI ↔ результат. Добавлено поле `direction` в `BacktestRequest` с приоритетом request > builder_graph.
    - **BUG-2 (КРИТИЧЕСКИЙ):** `position_size` и `position_size_type` из UI игнорировались — поля отсутствовали в `BacktestRequest`. Все бэктесты запускались с position_size=1.0 (100%), независимо от настройки. Добавлены оба поля, значение передаётся в `BacktestConfig`.
    - **BUG-3 (СРЕДНИЙ):** `BacktestRequest` не валидировал `symbol`, `interval`, `market_type`, `direction`, `position_size_type` — любая строка принималась, ошибки вылетали позже как 500 вместо 422. Добавлены `@field_validator` для всех полей.
    - Добавлены constraint'ы: `symbol` min=2/max=20, `commission` ge=0/le=0.01, `initial_capital` le=100M
    - Документация: `docs/AUDIT_PROPERTIES_PANEL.md`
    - Тесты: `tests/backend/api/test_properties_panel.py` — 46 тестов (валидация + интеграция)

### Fixed

- **Optimization `engine_type: "optimization"` 500 Error:** исправлен баг, при котором `engine_type="optimization"` вызывал 500 Internal Server Error в `/api/v1/optimizations/sync/grid-search`. Причина: `"optimization"` не был включён в условие single-process режима (строка 2316 в `optimizations.py`). Теперь `engine_type="optimization"` корректно обрабатывается как single-process Numba-движок.

### Added

- **MCP DeepSeek (Node.js) для Cursor:** папка `mcp-deepseek/` — MCP-сервер на Node.js с инструментами `deepseek_chat` и `deepseek_code_completion`. В `.cursor/mcp.json` добавлен сервер `deepseek-node` (запуск через `cmd /c cd /d ...\mcp-deepseek && node server.js`). API-ключ задаётся в env или в `mcp-deepseek/.env` (не в репозитории). См. `mcp-deepseek/README.md`.

- **Выполнены рекомендации аудита:** удалён router_registry.py; API инвентаризация (docs/API_INVENTORY.md, legacy markers); консолидация docs + план декомпозиции strategy_builder.js (STRATEGY_BUILDER_INDEX.md); тесты test_fast_optimizer.py, test_live_trading_services.py; план API v2 (STATE_MANAGEMENT_AND_API_VERSIONING.md).
- **sync-all-tf:** блокирующие операции БД (чтение audit, persist) перенесены в thread pool (`asyncio.to_thread`), чтобы не блокировать event loop. Синхронизация 9 таймфреймов теперь выполняется параллельно и быстрее.
- **Окно Параметры (audit):** восстановление commission при загрузке; \_commission в buildStrategyPayload; убрана ссылка на initialCapital. Backend: CreateStrategyRequest/StrategyResponse расширены (leverage, position_size, parameters) — полная end-to-end поддержка сохранения/восстановления параметров. Документация: `docs/AUDIT_PARAMETERS_WINDOW.md`, тесты: `tests/test_e2e_parameters_window.py`.
- **Блок «Библиотека» (audit):** исправлена передача category; mapBlocksToBackendParams включает close_conditions. **Унификация параметров:** функция `_param()` в strategy_builder_adapter — fallback snake_case/camelCase для macd, bollinger, stochastic, qqe, stoch_rsi, ichimoku, parabolic_sar, keltner, filters. Документация: `docs/AUDIT_LIBRARY_BLOCK.md`.

### База Даннах (Dunnah Base) — управление тикерами в БД (2026-01-31)

- **Новая секция Properties «🗄️ База Даннах»:** отображает группы тикеров в БД (Symbol + Market Type + интервалы).
- **Удаление:** кнопка «Удалить» — удаляет все свечи тикера из БД.
- **Блокировка догрузки:** кнопки «Блокировать» / «Разблокировать» — тикеры в списке блокировки не догружаются при start_all (update_market_data), в DB Maintenance и при выборе в Properties.
- **Хранение блокировки:** `data/blocked_tickers.json`.
- **API:** GET/POST/DELETE `/symbols/blocked`, GET `/symbols/db-groups`, DELETE `/symbols/db-groups`.
- **Значок 🔒** в списке тикеров (Symbol) для заблокированных.

### Контроль устаревания БД — точный порог 2 года (2026-01-31)

- **Система уже была:** `db_maintenance_server.py` → `retention_cleanup`, задача `retention_cleanup` по расписанию (раз в 30 дней).
- **Исправление:** Расчёт порога заменён на точные 2 года (730 дней от текущей даты) вместо границ года; используется `RETENTION_YEARS` из `database_policy.py`.

### Нахлёст свечей при догрузке (2026-01-31)

- **Задача:** При проверке актуальности БД (start_all → update_market_data, DB Maintenance, Properties sync) догружать с нахлёстом нескольких свечей, чтобы избежать gaps на границе.
- **Реализация:** Переменный нахлёст по TF: 5 для 1m–60m, 4 для 4h, 3 для D, 2 для W/M.
- **Где:** `marketdata.py` (sync-all-tf, refresh), `update_market_data.py`, `db_maintenance_server.py` (\_update_stale_data).
- **DB maintenance:** INSERT OR REPLACE для перезаписи граничных свечей в зоне нахлёста.

### Единый набор таймфреймов: 1m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 60m, 4h, 1D, 1W, 1M (2026-01-31)

- Ограничен набор таймфреймов для всех систем.
- Backend: ALL_TIMEFRAMES, interval_ms_map, freshness_thresholds, tf_timeouts — добавлен M, обновлены.
- Frontend: Strategy Builder и Strategies — выпадающие списки только с этим набором; BYBIT_TF_OPTS, BYBIT_INTERVALS.
- DB maintenance, show_db, sync_missing_data — обновлены intervals.
- Устаревшие TF (3m, 2h, 6h, 12h) при загрузке стратегий маппятся на ближайший: 3→5, 120→60, 360→240, 720→D.

### Strategy Builder: зависание при быстром переключении тикеров (2026-01-31)

- **Проблема:** При переключении на другой тикер сразу после загрузки предыдущего новая загрузка зависала.
- **Причина:** Две синхронизации (старая и новая) выполнялись параллельно и конкурировали за ресурсы.
- **Исправление:** При старте синхронизации нового тикера отменяется предыдущий fetch (AbortController). Отменённая синхронизация не обновляет UI.

### Strategy Builder: таймаут синхронизации и сообщение об ошибке (2026-01-31)

- **Проблема:** Для некоторых тикеров (напр. 1000000BABYDOGEUSDT) показывалось «Синхронизация в фоне», но загрузка фактически прерывалась — данные не загружались.
- **Причина:** Таймаут 15 с был слишком мал; синхронизация 8 TF (включая 1m) занимает 1–2 мин. При отмене запроса бэкенд также прерывался.
- **Исправления:** Таймаут увеличен до 120 с; при таймауте показывается явное сообщение об ошибке; клик по блоку статуса при ошибке запускает повторную попытку.

### Strategy Builder: Properties — сворачивание при выборе тикера и вкладки (2026-01-31)

- **Проблема:** При выборе тикера панель Properties закрывалась; после повторного открытия секции (ОСНОВНЫЕ ПАРАМЕТРЫ, EVALUATION CRITERIA и др.) не раскрывались.
- **Причины:** (1) Клик по выпадающему списку тикеров (он в body) воспринимался как «вне панели» и вызывал сворачивание. (2) При открытии sidebar не раскрывалась первая секция. (3) Два обработчика на заголовки секций (sidebar-toggle и strategy_builder) приводили к двойному toggle.
- **Исправления:** Исключение `#backtestSymbolDropdown` из логики «клик вне панели»; событие `properties-symbol-selected` для сброса таймера сворачивания при выборе тикера; при открытии sidebar раскрывается первая секция; удалён дублирующий обработчик в strategy_builder, остаётся только sidebar-toggle.js.

### Strategy Builder: загрузка/догрузка тикера и автоактуализация (2026-01-31)

- **Выбор тикера:** При выборе тикера из выпадающего списка (Symbol) выполняется синхронизация: если тикер не в БД — полная загрузка на всех TF (1m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 1h, 4h, D, W); если есть — догрузка актуальных свечей.
- **Тип рынка:** При смене SPOT/LINEAR (бессрочные фьючерсы) для выбранного тикера запускается синхронизация данных.
- **Backend:** В `/symbols/sync-all-tf` добавлен фильтр `market_type` в запросах к БД (корректное разделение spot/linear). В список синхронизируемых TF включён 1m.
- **Автоактуализация:** После успешной синхронизации запускается таймер обновления: 1m/5m — каждые 5 мин; 15m — каждые 15 мин; 30m — каждые 30 мин; 1h — 1 ч; 4h — 4 ч; D — 1 день; W — 1 неделя. При смене TF или тикера таймер перезапускается.

### Список тикеров Bybit в Strategy Builder (2026-01-31)

- **Проблема:** В поле Symbol (Properties) отображалось только 3 тикера вместо полного списка (~500). Список не открывался/не закрывался, не прокручивался; при обновлении тикеров загружался один тип рынка; при сбое сети кэш затирался пустым списком.
- **Причины:** (1) Два обработчика на GET `/api/v1/marketdata/symbols-list` (marketdata + tickers_api) — срабатывал первый, без полной пагинации Bybit. (2) Bybit API instruments-info отдаёт данные постранично (limit/cursor) — загружалась только первая страница. (3) Фронт ограничивал список до 100/80 пунктов; выпадающий список открывался при загрузке страницы и перекрывался соседними элементами (z-index, overflow). (4) refresh-tickers при падении одной категории перезаписывал кэш пустым списком.
- **Исправления:** Единственный обработчик symbols-list — tickers_api (дубликат в marketdata удалён). В `BybitAdapter.get_symbols_list()` добавлена полная пагинация (limit=1000, cursor/nextPageCursor), проверка retCode в ответе Bybit, таймаут ≥30 с, логирование количества тикеров. Регистрация маршрутов symbols-list и refresh-tickers на уровне app через `add_api_route`. На фронте: выпадающий список открывается только по focus/click; закрытие по клику вне и через `closeSymbolDropdown()`; z-index 100000, max-height 220px, overflow-y auto; отображается до 500 тикеров (без обрезки до 100). В refresh-tickers кэш обновляется только при непустом ответе (при сбое одной категории вторая не затирается). Пороги slow_requests для путей symbols и refresh-tickers увеличены (long_running_paths).
- **Документация:** Добавлен `docs/TICKERS_SYMBOLS_LIST.md` с описанием проблемы, потока данных и проверки. Скрипт `scripts/test_bybit_symbols_direct.py` для прямой проверки Bybit API.

### Strategy Builder: Properties — работоспособность и все настройки (2026-01-30)

- **Разделение панели Properties:** Поля стратегии (Основные: тип рынка, направление; Data & Timeframe: timeframe, symbol, capital) вынесены в отдельный контейнер `#strategyBasicProps` и больше не перезаписываются при выборе блока. Параметры блока выводятся в отдельной секции «Параметры блока» (`#blockProperties`) — при выборе блока там отображаются Name/Type/Category и параметры из customLayouts или fallback.
- **Backtest Settings:** Добавлено редактируемое поле Commission % (`#backtestCommission`, по умолчанию 0.07); значение передаётся в `buildBacktestRequest()` (в API уходит commission / 100, например 0.0007). При загрузке стратегии поля Backtest Settings синхронизируются с данными стратегии: symbol, initial_capital, leverage, direction.
- **Тексты:** Заглушка при отсутствии выбранного блока приведена к русскому: «Выберите блок на холсте, чтобы редактировать его параметры.»

### Strategy Builder: исправления по аудиту Properties и Библиотека (2026-01-30)

- **Properties панель:** При выборе блока в правой панели параметры выводятся через `renderGroupedParams(block, false)` (customLayouts) — те же checkbox/select/number, что и в popup. Для блоков без layout сохранён fallback с текстовыми полями. Обработка изменений — делегированная в `setupEventListeners()` на `#propertiesPanel` (change/input по полям с `data-param-key`, используется `selectedBlockId`). Добавлена `escapeHtml()` для безопасного вывода.
- **Библиотека:** В `renderBlockLibrary()` добавлены 10 категорий: Correlation & Multi-Symbol, Alerts, Visualization, DCA Grid, Multiple Take Profits, ATR Exit, Signal Memory, Close Conditions (TradingView), Price Action Patterns, Divergence. Для отсутствующих ключей — проверка `if (!blocks || !Array.isArray(blocks)) return`.
- **UI:** Секция Properties «Закладка-2» переименована в «Data & Timeframe». Документ аудита `docs/STRATEGY_BUILDER_PROPERTIES_LIBRARY_AUDIT.md` обновлён (рекомендации отмечены выполненными).

### Signal Memory в рантайме (2026-01-30)

- **StrategyBuilderAdapter:** Добавлен хелпер `apply_signal_memory(buy_events, sell_events, memory_bars)` — расширение buy/sell на N баров после события; противоположный сигнал отменяет память. Применён в фильтрах: **rsi_filter** (use_signal_memory / signal_memory_bars), **stochastic_filter** (activate_stoch_cross_memory / stoch_cross_memory_bars, activate_stoch_kd_memory / stoch_kd_memory_bars), **two_ma_filter** (ma_cross_memory_bars), **macd_filter** (macd_signal_memory_bars, disable_macd_signal_memory=False).
- **Исправления:** В `_execute_filter` для stochastic_filter и macd_filter исправлена распаковка результата: `calculate_stochastic` и `calculate_macd` возвращают кортежи, не словари. Порядок аргументов `calculate_stochastic(high, low, close, ...)` приведён к сигнатуре.
- **Тесты:** Добавлен `tests/test_signal_memory_adapter.py` (5 тестов: RSI memory extend, RSI no memory, Stochastic cross memory, Two MA memory, MACD memory).

### План REMAINING: комиссия 0.07%, Python, документация (2026-01-30)

- **Дефолт комиссии 0.07% (TradingView parity):** Во всех сценариях бэктеста и оптимизации по умолчанию установлено 0.0007: `backend/backtesting/models.py` (commission_value), `backend/api/routers/optimizations.py` (4 места), `backend/tasks/backtest_tasks.py`, `backend/services/data_service.py`, `backend/services/advanced_backtesting/portfolio.py`, `backend/backtesting/optimizer.py`, `backend/backtesting/gpu_optimizer.py`, `backend/backtesting/gpu_batch_optimizer.py`, `backend/backtesting/fast_optimizer.py`, `backend/backtesting/vectorbt_optimizer.py`.
- **Версия Python в правилах:** В `.cursor/rules/project.mdc` — «3.11+ (рекомендуется 3.14)»; в `AGENTS.MD` — «Python 3.11+ required (3.14 recommended)»; в `README.md` — «3.11+ (3.12/3.13/3.14 supported; 3.14 recommended for dev)».
- **Документация:** Обновлены `docs/tradingview_dca_import/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` (Phase 3–4 чеклисты, Next Steps), `docs/SESSION_5_4_AUDIT_REPORT.md` (WebSocket UI — Done, итоговая таблица), `docs/FULL_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (Phase 1.1–1.2 [x], WS интегрирован), `docs/REMAINING_AND_NEW_TASKS.md` (комиссия и Python отмечены выполненными, секция документации — выполнено).

### Синхронизация документации и задачи (2026-01-30)

- **Маппинг Strategy Builder → DCAEngine:** В `StrategyBuilderAdapter.extract_dca_config()` добавлен сбор блоков close_conditions и indent_order; в `strategy_builder.py` в `strategy_params` передаются `close_conditions` и `indent_order`; в `DCAEngine._configure_from_config()` — чтение и применение. В `run_from_config` добавлены `_precompute_close_condition_indicators`, логика indent_order при входе.
- **DCAEngine:** Исправлен `EquityCurve` в результате бэктеста: поле `equity` вместо `values`, timestamps как datetime.
- **E2E:** Добавлен `tests/test_e2e_dca_close_condition.py` (3 теста: time_bars_close, indent_order config, rsi_close config).
- **Signal Memory:** В `docs/REMAINING_AND_NEW_TASKS.md` зафиксировано назначение и место применения.
- **except Exception: pass:** Заменены на логирование в `backend/services/adapters/bybit.py` и `backend/database/sqlite_pool.py`.
- **Документация:** Обновлены SESSION_5_4_AUDIT_REPORT.md, REMAINING_AND_NEW_TASKS.md.

```python
from backend.core.indicators import (
    calculate_rsi,
    calculate_sma,
    calculate_ema,
    calculate_macd,
    calculate_bollinger,

### 🔧 NumbaEngine V4+ Extended Features (2026-01-28)

**Расширение NumbaEngine до 95%+ паритета с FallbackEngine**

#### Добавлены новые фичи в NumbaEngine:

1. **Breakeven Stop** — Перемещение SL в безубыток после TP1
    - `breakeven_enabled: bool`
    - `breakeven_offset: float` (например, 0.001 = +0.1% от входа)

2. **Time-based Exits** — Закрытие по времени
    - `max_bars_in_trade: int` (0 = отключено)
    - Новый exit_reason = 5

3. **Re-entry Rules** — Правила повторного входа
    - `re_entry_delay_bars: int` — Задержка после выхода
    - `max_trades_per_day: int` — Лимит сделок в день
    - `cooldown_after_loss: int` — Пауза после убытка
    - `max_consecutive_losses: int` — Стоп после N убытков подряд

4. **Market Filters** — Фильтры рыночных условий
    - `volatility_filter_enabled` — Фильтр по ATR percentile
    - `volume_filter_enabled` — Фильтр по объёму
    - `trend_filter_enabled` — Фильтр по SMA (with/against trend)

5. **Funding Rate** — Учёт фандинга для фьючерсов
    - `include_funding: bool`
    - `funding_rate: float` (например, 0.0001 = 0.01%)
    - `funding_interval: int` (баров между выплатами)

6. **Advanced Slippage Model** — Динамический slippage
    - `slippage_model: "fixed" | "advanced"`
    - Учитывает волатильность (ATR) и объём

#### Feature Matrix обновлена:

| Feature           | Fallback |   Numba    |
| ----------------- | :------: | :--------: |
| All V4 features   |    ✓     |     ✓      |
| Breakeven Stop    |    ✓     |     ✓      |
| Time-based Exit   |    ✓     |     ✓      |
| Re-entry Rules    |    ✓     |     ✓      |
| Market Filters    |    ✓     |     ✓      |
| Funding Rate      |    ✓     |     ✓      |
| **Adv. Slippage** |    ✓     | ✓ ← FIXED! |
| **FIFO/LIFO**     |    ✓     | ✓ ← FIXED! |

**Advanced Slippage - полная реализация:**

- В обоих движках реализован расчёт `slippage_multipliers` на основе ATR и объёма
- Multipliers применяются динамически на каждом баре: `effective_slippage = slippage * slippage_multipliers[i]`
- Учитывается волатильность (ATR%) и объём (относительно среднего)
- **Статус:** Полностью реализовано в обоих движках, 100% паритет

**Решение для FIFO/LIFO в Numba:**

- Используется маркировка закрытых entries (массив `long_entry_closed`, `short_entry_closed`)
- При FIFO - закрывается первый открытый entry
- При LIFO - закрывается последний открытый entry
- При ALL (по умолчанию) - закрываются все entries сразу
- SL/TP всегда закрывают ВСЕ entries (стандартное поведение TradingView)

### 🚀 Server Startup Optimization (2026-01-28)

**РЕЗУЛЬТАТ: Время старта ~60 сек → ~12 сек (FAST_DEV_MODE) / ~15 сек (обычный)**

#### Изменения:

1. **backend/backtesting/**init**.py** — Lazy loading для тяжёлых модулей
    - `optimizer`, `walk_forward`, `position_sizing` загружаются ТОЛЬКО при обращении
    - Используется `__getattr__` для динамической загрузки
    - GPU/Numba инициализация отложена до первого использования
    - **Экономия: ~30-50 секунд при старте**

2. **backend/backtesting/gpu_optimizer.py** — Lazy GPU initialization
    - CuPy импортируется только при вызове `is_gpu_available()` или GPU-функций
    - `GPU_AVAILABLE = None` (not checked) → `True/False` после первой проверки
    - Функция `_init_gpu()` делает одноразовую инициализацию
    - **Экономия: ~8-15 секунд на машинах без/с NVIDIA GPU**

3. **backend/api/lifespan.py** — Parallel warmup + FAST_DEV_MODE
    - JIT и Cache warmup выполняются параллельно (`asyncio.gather`)
    - `FAST_DEV_MODE=1` пропускает warmup полностью
    - **Экономия: ~3-5 секунд при параллельном warmup**

#### Использование:

```bash
# Быстрый старт для разработки
$env:FAST_DEV_MODE='1'
uvicorn backend.api.app:app --reload

# Production (warmup выполняется, но GPU ленивый)
uvicorn backend.api.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

#### Важные заметки:

- GPU инициализируется при первом вызове оптимизации (не при старте)
- Numba JIT компилируется при первом бэктесте (если FAST_DEV_MODE)
- Lazy loading не влияет на функциональность - всё работает как прежде

---

### NumbaEngine DCA Support (2026-01-28)

- **backend/backtesting/engines/numba_engine_v2.py** — added DCA (Safety Orders) support
    - Added DCA parameters to `_simulate_trades_numba_v4`:
        - `dca_enabled`, `dca_num_so`, `dca_levels`, `dca_volumes`, `dca_base_order_size`
    - DCA logic: Safety Orders trigger as price drops (long) / rises (short)
    - Pre-calculated cumulative deviation levels and volumes
    - Full reset on position close
    - Added `supports_dca` property
    - Updated docstrings

### GPUEngineV2 Deprecated (2026-01-28)

- **backend/backtesting/engines/gpu_engine_v2.py** — marked as deprecated
    - Added DeprecationWarning in `__init__`
    - Updated docstrings with migration guide
    - Reason: V2-only features, requires NVIDIA, NumbaEngine is sufficient

---

### Engine Consolidation Phase 1 - Unified FallbackEngine (2026-01-28)

#### Consolidated Engine Architecture

- **`FallbackEngine`** = `FallbackEngineV4` (основной эталон)
- **`NumbaEngine`** = `NumbaEngineV2` (быстрый, полный V4)
- **V2/V3** — deprecated aliases (работают, выдают DeprecationWarning)

#### Updated Exports (`backend/backtesting/engines/__init__.py`)

```python
from backend.backtesting.engines import (
    FallbackEngine,   # = V4 (основной)
    NumbaEngine,      # = NumbaEngineV2 (быстрый)
    FallbackEngineV4, # explicit
    NumbaEngineV2,    # explicit
    FallbackEngineV2, # deprecated
    FallbackEngineV3, # deprecated
)
```

#### Migration Guide

```python
# Old way:
from backend.backtesting.engines.fallback_engine_v2 import FallbackEngineV2
engine = FallbackEngineV2()

# New way:
from backend.backtesting.engines import FallbackEngine
engine = FallbackEngine()  # = V4, все фичи
```

---

### Engine Consolidation Phase 4 - Deprecated RSI-only Optimizers (2026-01-28)

#### Deprecated Modules

Marked as deprecated (will be removed in v3.0):

- **backend/backtesting/fast_optimizer.py** - RSI-only Numba optimizer
- **backend/backtesting/gpu_optimizer.py** - RSI-only GPU/CuPy optimizer
- **backend/backtesting/optimizer.py** - UniversalOptimizer wrapper

#### Reasons for Deprecation

1. **RSI-only** — these optimizers don't support:
    - Pyramiding (multiple entries)
    - ATR-based SL/TP (dynamic stops)
    - Multi-level TP (partial profit taking)
    - Trailing stop
    - Custom strategies

2. **Replaced by NumbaEngineV2** — full V4 functionality with 20-40x speedup:
    - All V4 features supported
    - Works on any CPU (no NVIDIA required)
    - Simpler codebase, easier maintenance

#### Migration Guide

```python
# Old way (deprecated):
from backend.backtesting.optimizer import UniversalOptimizer
result = UniversalOptimizer().optimize(...)

# New way (recommended):
from backend.backtesting.engine_selector import get_engine
from backend.backtesting.interfaces import BacktestInput
import itertools

engine = get_engine("numba")  # NumbaEngineV2 with full V4 support

for params in itertools.product(rsi_periods, stop_losses, ...):
    input_data = BacktestInput(...params...)
    output = engine.run(input_data)
    # process results
```

**Related:** Phase 2-3 added full V4 support to NumbaEngineV2 (pyramiding, ATR, multi-TP, trailing) with 100% parity to FallbackEngineV4.

---

### Startup Performance Optimizations (2026-01-28)

#### 1. Lazy GPU Initialization

- **backend/backtesting/gpu_optimizer.py** - GPU/CuPy теперь загружается ТОЛЬКО при первом использовании
    - Убрано: импорт CuPy при загрузке модуля (~8-15 сек)
    - Добавлено: `_init_gpu()` и `is_gpu_available()` для lazy loading
    - Все использования `GPU_AVAILABLE` заменены на `is_gpu_available()`
    - **Экономия:** 8-15 секунд при обычном запуске (когда GPU не нужен)

#### 2. Parallel Warmup

- **backend/api/lifespan.py** - JIT и cache warmup теперь выполняются параллельно
    - JIT warmup (CPU-bound) и cache warmup (I/O-bound) запускаются через `asyncio.gather()`
    - **Экономия:** ~8 секунд (вместо последовательного ожидания)

#### 3. FAST_DEV_MODE Environment Variable

- **backend/api/lifespan.py** - Добавлена переменная окружения `FAST_DEV_MODE`
    - При `FAST_DEV_MODE=1` пропускается весь warmup
    - Идеально для разработки: запуск за ~1-2 секунды вместо 45-90
    - Использование: `$env:FAST_DEV_MODE = "1"; uvicorn backend.api.app:app`

**Итоговое улучшение:**

- Обычный запуск: 45-90 сек → ~25-35 сек (параллельный warmup)
- Режим разработки: 45-90 сек → ~1-2 сек (FAST_DEV_MODE=1)

### Startup Script Fixes (2026-01-28)

#### Fixed Import Error

- **backend/middleware/csrf.py** - Fixed incorrect import `from backend.core.logging` → `from backend.core.logging_config`

#### Added Root Health Endpoints

- **backend/api/app.py** - Added `/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/livez` at root level for K8s probes and startup scripts
    - Previously these endpoints only existed at `/api/v1/health/healthz`
    - Now `start_all.ps1` can properly check server readiness

#### Verified Startup Flow

- **start_all.ps1** - Verified all steps work correctly:
    1. ✅ stop_all.ps1 - Stops all services and clears cache
    2. ✅ start_redis.ps1 - Starts Redis on port 6379
    3. ✅ start_kline_db_service.ps1 - Starts Kline DB Service
    4. ✅ start_mcp_server.ps1 - Starts MCP Server
    5. ✅ start_uvicorn.ps1 - Starts Uvicorn on port 8000
    6. ✅ Health check waits for `/healthz` to return `{status: "ok"}`
    7. ✅ start_agent_service.ps1 - Starts AI Agent Service
    8. ✅ Opens browser to http://localhost:8000

### Universal Engine & Performance Spec (2026-01-28)

**ПРИНЯТОЕ РЕШЕНИЕ: Консолидация до 2 движков**

- **§11 Консолидация:** вместо 8 подсистем — **2 движка**:
    - **FallbackEngine** — эталон (все фичи V4)
    - **NumbaEngine** — оптимизация (точность + скорость, расширить до V4)
    - **GPU — откладываем** (сложнее, требует NVIDIA, выигрыш только на 100K+ комбинаций)

**Реализация Фазы 1 (частично):**

- **backend/backtesting/engines/**init**.py** — добавлен `FallbackEngine = FallbackEngineV4`
- **backend/backtesting/engine_selector.py** — обновлена логика:
    - `auto` / `fallback` / `v4` → FallbackEngineV4 (основной)
    - `pyramiding > 1` → FallbackEngineV4 (вместо V3)
    - `fallback_v2` / `fallback_v3` → deprecated с warning
- **fallback_engine_v2.py** — добавлен DeprecationWarning
- **fallback_engine_v3.py** — добавлен DeprecationWarning

**Реализация Фазы 2 (Numba V3 — pyramiding):**

- **backend/backtesting/engines/numba_engine_v2.py**:
    - Новая функция `_simulate_trades_numba_pyramiding` (~350 строк)
    - Поддержка pyramiding > 1 (несколько входов в одну сторону)
    - Средневзвешенная цена входа для SL/TP
    - Закрытие ALL (все позиции сразу)
    - Свойство `supports_pyramiding = True`

**Реализация Фазы 2 (Numba V4 — полный функционал):**

- **backend/backtesting/engines/numba_engine_v2.py**:
    - Новая функция `_simulate_trades_numba_v4` (~700 строк) с полной поддержкой:

### DeepSeek/Perplexity Agents Audit (2026-01-28)

Полный аудит системы агентов DeepSeek и Perplexity.

#### Bug Fixes (P0 Critical)

1. **Import Fix** (`backend/api/deepseek_client.py`, `backend/api/perplexity_client.py`):
    - Исправлен неправильный импорт `from reliability.retry_policy`
    - Теперь: `from backend.reliability.retry_policy`

2. **Health Check Logic Fix** (`backend/api/perplexity_client.py`):
    - **Было**: `is_healthy = response.status_code in [200, 400, 401, 403]`
    - **Стало**: `is_healthy = response.status_code == 200`
    - 401/403 — это ошибки авторизации, а не healthy статус

#### Documentation

3. **Agents Audit Report** (`docs/DEEPSEEK_PERPLEXITY_AGENTS_AUDIT.md`):
    - Анализ 6 ключевых файлов системы агентов
    - Найдено 2 критических бага (исправлены)
    - 5 средних проблем (рекомендации)
    - Рекомендации по декомпозиции unified_agent_interface.py (2926+ строк)

#### Fixed Issues (P1-P2)

1. **P2 Fix: KeyManager in real_llm_deliberation.py** — Now uses secure KeyManager instead of os.environ
2. **P1 Fix: Circuit Breaker in connections.py** — Added circuit breaker integration to DeepSeekClient and PerplexityClient
3. **P1 Fix: Modular api_key_pool.py** — Extracted APIKeyPoolManager for better modularity (304 lines)

#### DeepSeek MCP Demo

- **deepseek_code** инструмент работает! Сгенерирована торговая стратегия:
    - `backend/backtesting/strategies/momentum_rsi_ema.py`
    - RSI + EMA crossover с ATR-based SL/TP
    - Полностью совместима с VectorBT и Fallback движками

#### Agent Strategy Orchestration Spec (2026-01-28)

- **Новая спецификация** `docs/ai/AGENT_STRATEGY_ORCHESTRATION_SPEC.md`:
    - Разбор предложения: Perplexity (аналитика) → DeepSeek (консенсус, код/Lego) → бэктест → Perplexity (params) → DeepSeek (второе мнение, оптимизация) → отсев → цикл/эволюция Lego
    - Идеи по отсеву: критерии от агентов, ML, гибрид, Pareto
    - Сопоставление с `RealLLMDeliberation`, `AIBacktestAnalyzer`, `AIOptimizationAnalyzer`, `StrategyBuilder`, `CodeGenerator`, `fast_optimizer`
    - Поэтапный план внедрения
- **Дополнение (размышления):**
    - **§0 Точка старта:** ввод пользователя до генерации стратегии — symbol, interval, capital, direction, position_size, leverage, commission, pyramiding, strategy_type (DCA/Grid/RSI/…), + property из `BacktestConfig`/`BacktestInput`. Агенты могут предлагать свои варианты (ТФ, тип, плечо, фильтры). Уровни плеча — перебор 1x/2x/5x/10x по решению оркестратора.
    - **§2.10 Мульти-ТФ, мульти-период, критерии качества:** проверка на разных ТФ (15m, 1h, 4h, 1d); профили conservative/balanced/aggressive/robustness с разными весами (Calmar, Sharpe, return, OOS); «хитрые методы» — множественные календарные периоды, Walk-Forward (rolling/anchored), MTF Walk-Forward, стресс-периоды, Monte Carlo. Связка ТФ + профиль + метод + leverage → градации агрессивности. Опора на `MTFOptimizer`, `WalkForwardOptimizer`, `MTFWalkForward`, `MetricsCalculator`.
    - В план внедрения: фаза **0** (схема `UserStrategyInput`, точка старта), фаза **2b** (мульти-ТФ, мульти-период, профили).
