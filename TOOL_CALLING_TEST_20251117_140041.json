  "content": "I apologize, but it appears there's a technical issue with the tool execution system. The MCP tools are not functioning as expected, which prevents me from reading the file and analyzing the code for MCP tools.\n\nBased on the task context, you're asking me to:\n1. Read the file `backend/api/app.py`\n2. List all MCP tools I find in that file\n\nHowever, without being able to access the file content, I cannot provide you with the specific MCP tools used in that code. \n\nTo help you further, you might want to:\n- Check if the file path `backend/api/app.py` exists in your project\n- Verify that the MCP tool system is functioning properly\n- Alternatively, you could share the content of the file directly, and I can analyze it for MCP tools\n\nIf you can provide the file content, I'd be happy to identify and list all the MCP tools used in the code.",
